<li>You can build a single model by feature selection as you said. Otherwise you can also try to use Domingos' method in [Knowledge acquisition from examples via multiple models] that consists in building a new dataset with black-box predictions and build a decision tree on top of it. </li>

Thus, it is better to use a black-box model. The final aim of an end user is to understand why a new record is classified as a particular class. You might think about some feature importances just for that particular record.</li>

<p>The plot confirms the reported small group difference <code>groupII</code> of 0.05 at $x=0$ if we were to extrapolate back to 0.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the spline fit reports the group difference at the first $x$, i.e. $x=0.2$.</p>

57193,1717.0,2,,57175.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>When you use EM to obtain maximum likelihood estimates, you need a variable that describes your observations $x_{n}$, latent variables $z_{n}$ that are in some way related to your observations (e.g. in coin tossing experiments, $\{H, T\}$ are the latent variables and in gaussian mixtures, the mixing coefficients $\pi_{i}$ take the role of latent variables) and the parameters $\theta$ that you are trying to estimate.</p>

<p>At the risk of not answering your question at all, I think you want a maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$ using EM based on known observations $x_{n}$ that are given by the following equation:</p>

<p>$$x_{t} = s_{t}(\theta_{0}) + n_{t}$$</p>

<p>If that is correct, a general idea is the following. Since $n_{t}$ is white noise $N(0, \sigma)$, $x_{t}$ can be described by a Gaussian $p(x_{t}|s_{t},\theta) = N(s_{t}(\theta), \sigma)$. In the EM formulation, $x_{t}$'s are known variables, $s_{t}$'s are latent variables and $\theta$ is the parameter. It is customary to group the variables $x_{n}$ in a variable $X$ and likewise, latent variables $s_{n}$ are grouped in a variable $S$.</p>

<p>As you should know, the EM algorithm consists of 2 steps: expectation and maximization. In the expectation step, we use an expression $Q$ as a proxy for the likelihood $L(\theta|X) = p(X|\theta)$, that is, the probability of 
getting the known data $X$ given a parameter $\theta$. This is the same likelihood used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates. However, in EM we use this $Q$ instead:</p>

<p>$$Q(\theta|\theta^{\text{old}}) = E_{S|X, \theta^{\text{old}}} \log p(X,S|\theta)$$</p>

<p>This odd-looking expression is actually a lower bound of the likelihood $L(\theta|X)$. <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0387310738"" rel=""nofollow"">Bishop's book</a> contains a good derivation of $Q$.</p>

<p>In order to start the EM magic, you have to choose a random $\theta^{\text{old}}$ and calculate this expectation. Notice that you need $p(X,S|\theta)$ and $p(S|X,\theta^{\text{old}})$. $p(X,S|\theta)$ is equal to $p(X|S,\theta)p(S|\theta)$ and using Bayes' theorem, $p(S|X,\theta^{\text{old}})$ is 
proportional to $p(X|S,\theta^{\text{old}})p(S|\theta^{\text{old}})$.</p>

<p>At this point, I hope it is clear that $p(X|S,\theta)=\prod_{t} p(x_{t}|s_{t},\theta)$, so that part is not hard to calculate. However, $p(S|\theta)$, that is, $\prod_{t}p(s_{t}|\theta)$ is required. I don't know what distribution could be appropriate since this depends on the specifics of your problem so I will assume you know.</p>

<p>By now, you can calculate $Q(\theta|\theta^{\text{old}})$. </p>

<p>The maximization step is simply:</p>

<p>$$\theta = \text{arg max}_{\theta} Q(\theta|\theta^{\text{old}})$$</p>

<p>This is the new $\theta$ to be used in the expectation step again until convergence. </p>

<p>That is a general idea of how EM could work in this case. However, maybe you don't know a distribution for $s_{t}$ or it is difficult to calculate the expectation or the maximization step. </p>

<p>For the big picture, take a look at <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n8/pdf/nbt1406.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> nice explanation.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I think you changed the question quite a bit. Are you asking how to calculate maximum likelihood estimates? Basically, you apply a derivative to the likelihood on the parameter you want to estimate:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}L(\theta|X) = 0$$</p>

<p>solve it and that's pretty much it. See more examples <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood#Continuous_distribution.2C_continuous_parameter_space"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

This gives me a data frame that contains date, latitude, longitude, and some measured value. Assume that data are collected once per day and driven by regional-scale weather (no, we are not going to get into that discussion). </p>

<p>I'd like to show graphically how simultaneously-measured values are correlated across time and space. My goal is to show the regional homogeneity (or lack thereof) of the value that is being investigated. </p>

<h2>Data set</h2>

<p>To start with, I took a group of stations in the region of Massachusetts and Maine. I selected sites by latitude and longitude from an index file that is available on NOAA's FTP site.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZm4N.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Straight away you see one problem: there are lots of sites that have similar identifiers or are very close. FWIW, I identify them using both the USAF and WBAN codes. Looking deeper in to the metadata I saw that they have different coordinates and elevations, and data stop at one site then start at another. So, because I don't know any better, I have to treat them as separate stations. This means the data contains pairs of stations that are very close to each other.</p>

<h2>Preliminary Analysis</h2>

<p>I tried grouping the data by calendar month and then calculating the ordinary least squares regression between different pairs of data. I then plot the correlation between all pairs as a line connecting the stations (below). The line color shows the value of R2 from the OLS fit. The figure then shows how the 30+ data points from January, February, etc. are correlated between different stations in the area of interest. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X4YZI.jpg"" alt=""correlation between daily data during each calendar month""></p>

<p>I've written the underlying codes so that the daily mean is only calculated if there are data points every 6-hour period, so data should be comparable across sites.</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, there is simply too much data to make sense of on one plot. That can't be fixed by reducing the size of the lines. </p>

<p>I've tried plotting the correlations between the nearest neighbors in the region, but that turns into a mess very quickly. The facets below show the network without correlation values, using $k$ nearest neighbors from a subset of the stations. This figure was just to test the concept.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NWzm2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The network appears to be too complex, so I think I need to figure out a way to reduce the complexity, or apply some kind of spatial kernel.</p>

<p>I am also not sure what is the most appropriate metric to show correlation, but for the intended (non-technical) audience, the correlation coefficient from OLS might just be the simplest to explain. I may need to present some other information like the gradient or standard error as well.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>I'm learning my way into this field and R at the same time, and would appreciate suggestions on:</p>

<li>... in particular, methods that are easy to show results from visually?</li>

57196,668.0,2,,57192.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>You have the right idea.  This can be done systematically, comprehensively, and with relatively simple calculations.  A graph of the results is called a <em>normal probability plot</em> (or sometimes a P-P plot).  From it you can see <em>much</em> more detail than appears in other graphical representations, especially <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/51718/assessing-approximate-distribution-of-data-based-on-a-histogram/51753#51753"">histograms</a>, and with a little practice you can even learn to determine ways to re-express your data to make them closer to Normal in situations where that is warranted.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/giJwL.png"" alt=""Spreadsheet with probability plot""></p>

<p>Data are in column <code>A</code> (and named <code>Data</code>).  The rest is all calculation, although you can control the ""hinge rank"" value used to fit a reference line to the plot.</p>

<p>This plot is a scatterplot comparing the data to values that would be attained by numbers drawn independently from a standard Normal distribution.  When the points line up along the diagonal, they are close to Normal; horizontal departures (along the data axis) indicate departures from normality.  In this example the points are remarkably close to the reference line; the largest departure occurs at the highest value, which is about <span class=""math-container"">$1.5$</span> units to the left of the line.  Thus we see at a glance that these data are very close to Normally distributed but perhaps have a slightly ""light"" right tail.  This is perfectly fine for applying a t-test.</p>

<p>The comparison values on the vertical axis are computed in two steps.  First each data value is ranked from <span class=""math-container"">$1$</span> through <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span>, the amount of data (shown in the <code>Count</code> field in cell <code>F2</code>).  These are proportionally converted to values in the range <span class=""math-container"">$0$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$1$</span>.  A good formula to use is <span class=""math-container"">$\left(\text{rank}-1/6\right)/\left(n+2/3\right).$</span>  (See <a href=""http://www.quantdec.com/envstats/notes/class_02/characterizing_distributions.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.quantdec.com/envstats/notes/class_02/characterizing_distributions.htm</a> for where that comes from.)  Then these are converted to standard Normal values via the <code>NormSInv</code> function.  These values appear in the <code>Normal score</code> column.  The plot at the right is an XY scatterplot of <code>Normal Score</code> against the data.  (In some references you will see the transpose of this plot, which perhaps is more natural, but Excel prefers to place the leftmost column on the horizontal axis and the rightmost column on the vertical axis, so I have let it do what it prefers.)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iH7vw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iH7vw.png"" alt=""Spreadsheet: normal score calculation""></a></p>

<p>(As you can see, I simulated these data with independent random draws from a Normal distribution with mean <span class=""math-container"">$5$</span> and standard deviation <span class=""math-container"">$2$</span>.  It is therefore no surprise that the probability plot looks so nice.)  There really are only two formulas to type in, which you propagate downward to match the data: they appear in cells <code>B2:C2</code> and rely on the <code>Count</code> value computed in cell <code>F2</code>.  That's really all there is to it, apart from the plotting.</p>

<p>The rest of this sheet is not necessary but it's helpful for judging the plot: it provides a robust estimate of a reference line.  This is done by picking two points equally far in from the left and right of the plot and connecting them with a line.  In the example these points are the third lowest and third highest, as determined by the <span class=""math-container"">$3$</span> in the <code>Hinge Rank</code> cell, <code>F3</code>.  As a bonus, its slope and intercept are robust estimates of the standard deviation and mean of the data, respectively.</p>

<p>To plot the reference line, two extreme points are computed and added to the plot: their calculation occurs in columns <code>I:J</code>, labeled <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>.</p>

<p>In regression models with continuous predictor variables and no interaction terms -- that is, with no terms that are constructed as the product of other terms -- each variable's coefficient is the slope of the regression surface in the direction of that variable. It is constant, regardless of the values of the variables, and is obviously a measure of the effect of that variable.</p>

<p>In models with interactions -- that is, with terms that are constructed as the products of other terms -- that interpretation can be made without further qualification only for variables that are <strong>not</strong> involved in any interactions. The coefficient of a variable that <strong>is</strong> involved in interactions is the slope of the regression surface in the direction of that variable <strong>when the values of all the variables that interact with the variable in question are zero</strong>, and the significance test of the coefficient refers to the slope of the regression surface <strong>only in that region of the predictor space</strong>. Since there is no requirement that there actually be data in that region of the space, the apparent direct effect coefficient may bear little resemblance to the slope of the regression surface in the region of the predictor space where data were actually observed. There is no true ""direct effect"" in such cases; the best substitute is probably the ""average effect"": the slope of the regression surface in the direction of the variable in question, taken at each data point and averaged over all data points.

57206,22555.0,2,,57192.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>This question borders on statistics theory too - testing for normality with limited data may be questionable (although we all have done this from time to time).</p>

<p>As an alternative, you can look at kurtosis and skewness coefficients.  From <strong>Hahn and Shapiro: Statistical Models in Engineering</strong> some background is provided on the properties Beta1 and Beta2 (pages 42 to 49) and the Fig 6-1 of Page 197.  Additional theory behind this can be found on Wikipedia (see Pearson Distribution).</p>

<p>Basically you need to calculate the so-called properties Beta1 and Beta2.  A Beta1 = 0 and Beta2 = 3 suggests that the data set approaches normality.  This is a rough test but with limited data it could be argued that any test could be considered a rough one.</p>

<p>Beta1 is related to the moments 2 and 3, or variance and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness"" rel=""nofollow"">skewness</a>, respectively.  In Excel, these are VAR and SKEW.  Where ... is your data array, the formula is:</p>

<pre><code>Beta1 = SKEW(...)^2/VAR(...)^3
</code></pre>

<p>Beta2 is related to the moments 2 and 4, or the variance and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis"" rel=""nofollow"">kurtosis</a>, respectively.  In Excel, these are VAR and KURT.  Where ... is your data array, the formula is:</p>

<pre><code>Beta2 = KURT(...)/VAR(...)^2
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can check these against the values of 0 and 3, respectively.  This has the advantage of potentially identifying other distributions (including Pearson Distributions I, I(U), I(J), II, II(U), III, IV, V, VI, VII).  For example, many of the commonly used distributions such as Uniform, Normal, Student's t, Beta, Gamma, Exponential, and Log-Normal can be indicated from these properties:</p>

<pre><code>Where:   0 &lt;= Beta1 &lt;= 4
         1 &lt;= Beta2 &lt;= 10 

Uniform:        [0,1.8]                                 [point]

<p>Now, it seems to me that because each individual mean is an estimate itself, that we should be less certain about the group means than shown by the 95% confidence intervals indicated by the bottom-left panel in the figure above. Thus the p-values calculated are underestimating the true variability and should lead to increased false-positives if we wish to extrapolate to future data.</p>

<p>So what is the correct way to analyze this data?</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong></p>

<p>The example above is a simplification. For the actual data: </p>

<p>1) The within-subject variance is positively correlated with the mean. </p>

<p>2) Values can only be multiples of two. </p>

<p>3) The individual results are not roughly normally distributed. They suffer from zero floor effect, and have long tails at the positive end. </p>

<p>4) Number of Subjects in each group are not necessarily equal. </p>

<p>Previous literature has used the t-test ignoring within-subject variability and other nuances as was done for the simulations above. Are these results reliable? If I can extract some means and standard errors from the figures how would I calculate the ""correct"" p-values.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>In response to Henrik's answer:
So if I instead perform anova followed by TukeyHSD procedure on the individual averages as shown below, I could interpret this as underestimating my p-value by about 3-4x? </p>

<p>My goal with this part of the question is to understand how I, as a reader of a journal article, can better interpret previous results given their choice of analysis method. For example they have those ""stars of authority"" showing me 0.01>p>.001. So if i accept 0.05 as a reasonable cutoff I should accept their interpretation? The only additional information is mean and SEM.</p>

<p>I start with a some $v_0$.

According to the general linear structural equation model framework for testing mediation models first outlined by <a href=""https://umdrive.memphis.edu/grelyea/public/PUBH%207152-Stat%20Methods%20II/Chapter%2010/Mediation/Baron_&amp;_Kenny_1986.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Barron and Kenny (1986)</a> and described elsewhere such as <a href=""http://www.psor.ucl.ac.be/personal/yzerbyt/Judd%20et%20al.%20HRMSP%202013.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Judd, Yzerbyt, &amp; Muller (2013)</a>, mediation models for outcome $Y$, mediator $\newcommand{\med}{\rm med} \med$, and predictor $X$ and are governed by the following three regression equations:
\begin{align}
Y    &amp;= b_{11} + b_{12}X + e_1                \tag{1}  \\
\med &amp;= b_{21} + b_{22}X + e_2                \tag{2}  \\
Y    &amp;= b_{31} + b_{32}X + b_{32} \med + e_3  \tag{3}
\end{align}
The indirect effect or mediation effect of $X$ on $Y$ through $\med$ can either be defined as $b_{22}b_{32}$ or, equivalently, as $b_{12}-b_{32}$.  Under the old framework of testing for mediation, mediation was established by testing $b_{12}$ in equation 1, $b_{22}$ in equation 2, and $b_{32}$ in equation 3.</p>

<p>So far, I have attempted to simulate values of $\med$ and $Y$ that are consistent with values of the various regression coefficients using <code>rnorm</code> in <code>R</code>, such as the code below:</p>

<pre><code>x   &lt;- rep(c(-.5, .5), 50)
med &lt;- 4 + .7 * x + rnorm(100, sd = 1) 

# Check the relationship between x and med
mod &lt;- lm(med ~ x)

y &lt;- 2.5 + 0 * x + .4 * med + rnorm(100, sd = 1)

# Check the relationships between x, med, and y
mod &lt;- lm(y ~ x + med)
summary(mod)

# Check the relationship between x and y -- not present
mod &lt;- lm(y ~ x)
summary(mod)
</code></pre>

<p>However, it seems that sequentially generating $\med$ and $Y$ using equations 2 and 3 is not enough, since I am left with no relationship between $X$ and $Y$ in regression equation 1 (which models a simple bivariate relationship between $X$ and $Y$) using this approach.  This is important because one definition of the indirect (i.e., mediation) effect is $b_{12}-b_{32}$, as I describe above.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me find a procedure in R to generate variables $X$, $\med$, and $Y$ that satisfy constraints that I set using equations 1, 2, and 3?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Deming regression. I'm not sure that this would be the right approach. It seems to be more for data sets in which the same technique was used for both variables. If it is, my question is how would I calculate the variance ratio based on the information I have?</p></li>
<li><p>Regression of all underlying data points. This doesn't really work because the data are not meaningfully paired, so of the 80 or so microbial biomass measurements that underlie the data shown in the graphs here, I can't directly match them to individual measurements of carbohydrates. Matching them arbitrarily seems bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Regression of carbohydrate means by date against microbial biomass means by date. Basically regress the points in my scatterplot above but throw out the information about the uncertainty. This gives a high r2 driven by the coinciding peaks on July 1st, but to me, seems to overestimate the strength of the relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>Regression of all microbial biomass values against carbohydrate means by date or vice versa. This allows more of the underlying uncertainty to be incorporated while not forcing the pairing of unrelated data points in an arbitrary way. Again though, it does not incorporate the uncertainty in both variables.</p></li>

Some additional background information might be useful: I have a sensor device with known position and orientation in 2D space (in a future step both may have an uncertainty).

57243,20473.0,2,,57221.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>It appears you are confusing results that hold for a collection of random variables with the case of <em>one</em> random variable.</p>

<p>When you have a series of observations, $x_1,...,x_n$, then <strong><em>if</em></strong> they are <em>contemporaneous</em>, ($x_{1t},...,x_{nt}$) they are considered as realizations of <em>n distinct random variables</em> (that may be identically and independently distributed, or not). You <em>cannot</em>, in this case, assume that all are realizations of the <em>same</em> random variable, because a random variable is a real-valued function: this means that at a specific point in time, it can have only one realization (take one value), otherwise it wouldn't be a function but a correspondence: this is why when we have a <em>cross-sectional</em> sample of size $n$, we say that ""it is comprised of the realization of $n$ random variables"", and not  ""$n$ realizations of the same random variable"".  Note carefully that ""same"" does not just mean ""identically distributed"", but ontologically equal.</p>

<p>Assume now that you have a time-series, and the index $1,...,n$ represents different points in time. Can you say that they are all realizations of the <em>same</em> random variable? Well in principle you can, but here too, we tend to view a time series as a stochastic process of <em>distinct</em> random variables (one for each point in time), that, again, may be identically distributed.  </p>

<p>So in general, when looking at a sample, be it cross-sectional or time series, it is advisable to think of it as a collection of realizations of <em>many</em> random variables.</p>

<p>Now, when we subtract the mean from a random variable, and divide by the standard deviation, we create the ""standardized"" version of the variable, that has mean zero and variance (and standard deviation) unity. This is irrespective of the distribution that this variable follows, because, by standard universal properties of these distribution moments
$$Z = \frac {X-\mu}{\sigma} \Rightarrow E(Z) = \frac {1}{\sigma}E(X) - \frac {\mu}{\sigma} = 0$$</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>$$ \text {Var}(Z) = \text {Var}\left(\frac {X-\mu}{\sigma}\right) = \frac {1}{\sigma^2}\text {Var}(X) = \frac {\sigma^2}{\sigma^2} =1$$</p>

<p>The standardized version $Z$ of <em>one</em> random variable $X$ follows a distribution that belongs to the same family as the distribution of $X$, with different said parameters - the distribution <em>family</em> does not change. So if you don't know the distribution by other means, the distribution of the standardized version will remain unknown.</p>

<p>Now consider the random variable $S_n = \frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$. It is for this and like quantities that the various <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">Central Limit Theorems</a> talk about and tell that they approach a normal distribution asymptotically.</p>

The gene-dosage model (treating genotypes as ordinal) is more powerful because you are using information about the genotype groups (whether the group has 0, 1 or 2 copies of the wild type allele) whereas in the categorical approach your model knows nothing about the genotype groups (they could just be called A, B and C).

<p>If I want to test the interaction of <code>AGE</code>, <code>BMI</code> and <code>DRUG</code>, I need another model: <code>y2=a2*AGE+b2*BMI+c2*DRUG+d*(DRUG*AGE)+e*(DRUG*BMI)</code>; I got a likelihood 2;</p>

<p>Then I compare the likelihood of these two models using chi-square test (df=2), and see whether the difference (likelihood 2 minus likelihood) is significant. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>

<p>Stratify people into two groups according to DRUG status:</p>

<p>Group 1: for people taking DRUG (n=1000), model 1: <code>y1=a1*AGE+b1*BMI</code>, I got a likelihood 1 (L1);</p>

<p>Group 2: for people not taking DRUG (n=1000), model 2: <code>y2=a2*AGE+b2*BMI</code>, likelihood 2 (L2);</p>

<p>So in order to test the interactions, chi-square=L3/(L1*L2). But the question is: What is the degree of freedom (df)?</p>

In the end of the day I would like to know the average weight and variance of the individual units but the problem is that I cannot weight each unit individually since I would have to destroy the packet to get to the individual units. So in lieu of this, I am trying to make an inference of the individual units from what I know about the packets. I weighed 10 packets (hence I have 100 individual units). I was able to figure out the average weight of the units but am having trouble with the variance. Here is what I have done so far:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{split}
\bar{y}&amp;=\frac{1}{10}\sum^{10}_{i=1}y_i\\
       &amp;=\frac{1}{10}\sum^{10}_{i=1}  (x_{i,1}+x_{i,2}+...+x_{i,10})~~[since~y_i=x_{i,1}+x_{i,2}+...+x_{i,10}]\\
       &amp;=\frac{1}{10}\sum^{100}_{j=1}x_j\\
       &amp;=\frac{1}{10}(100~\bar{x})=10~\bar{x}
\end{split}
$$</p>

<p>thus we have the average of $x$, $\bar{x}=\frac{\bar{y}}{10}.$ But now my challenge is how to do I find variance of $x$ given the variance of $y$? Any suggestions? Thanks!</p>

<p>::::UPDATE::::</p>

<p>After some thought I came up with this reasoning:
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{10}var(y)&amp;=var(\bar{y})\\
       &amp;=var(10~\bar{x})\\
       &amp;=100~var(\bar{x})\\
       &amp;=100~\frac{1}{100}var(x)~~[assuming~that~all~x~are~i.i.d.]\\
       &amp;=var(x)
\end{split}
$$</p>

<p>thus we have $var(x)=\frac{1}{10}var(y).$ I am correct in that if we assume that all the individual units share the same common variance and are independent of each other, this result holds?</p>

<p>Next, observe that the characteristic function (cf) of <span class=""math-container"">$\Gamma(n, \beta)$</span> is <span class=""math-container"">$(1-i \beta  t)^{-n}$</span>, whence the cf of a sum of these distributions is the product</p>

<p>The inverse of taking the cf is the inverse Fourier Transform, which is <em>linear</em>: that means we may apply it term by term.  Each term is recognizable as a multiple of the cf of a Gamma distribution and so is readily <strong>inverted to yield the PDF</strong>.  In the example we obtain</p>

<p>This is a finite <em>mixture</em> of Gamma distributions having scale factors equal to those within the sum and shape factors less than or equal to those within the sum.

<h3>Indistinguishable situations</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this, we'll assume that <span class=""math-container"">$X$</span>, <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span>, and <span class=""math-container"">$Z$</span> are 0-mean multivariate normal distributions in <span class=""math-container"">$\mathbb{R}^d$</span>, and we're interested in one or more spectrum <span class=""math-container"">$\sigma_i$</span> (a vector of size <span class=""math-container"">$d$</span> with decreasing values, yada yada). I refer to the components of the spectrum as <em>eigenvalues</em>, without specifying that they're the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The true distribution is <span class=""math-container"">$X$</span> which has spectrum <span class=""math-container"">$\sigma_X$</span> with all non-zero values. There is no error, and we draw a large number of samples, estimating everything very accurately. Clearly all of the &quot;small&quot; eigenvalues still have &quot;information&quot; and aren't noise.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The true distribution  is <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> which has a spectrum <span class=""math-container"">$\sigma_Y$</span> with only 3 non-zero eigenvalues. There's noise, though, so we measure <span class=""math-container"">$Y+Z$</span>, where <span class=""math-container"">$\sigma_Z$</span> <em>does</em> have all non-zero eigenvalues. Let's suppose <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$Z$</span> are such that <span class=""math-container"">$\sigma_{Y+Z} = \sigma_X$</span>. Here, it's obvious that all but the top 3 eigenvalues are &quot;merely noise&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My point is just that which parts of the spectrum can be attributed to &quot;noise&quot; is not a property of the sample.</p>
<h3>External criteria</h3>
<p>There potentially are external criteria that can help you distinguish the above situations, but they're sort of problem specific. For instance, in the <a href=""http://www.netflixprize.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Netflix Challenge</a>, a very successful technique for predicting movie ratings was based on SVD (which is also the basis of PCA). When using SVD-based algorithms for a prediction task, one is confronted with the same challenge you have: <em>&quot;How many non-zero components do I consider? How far do I reduce the dimensionality?&quot;</em> The answer is basically <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cross validation</a>. The more components you consider, the lower your training error is, but the more risk of overfitting. The validation error is a proxy for generalization error. So, you generally get a chart like:</p>

<p>If you're not doing a predictive problem, I don't really have useful advice, but I do imagine there might be <em>something</em> you want to measure that can help you define what it <em>means</em> for something to be &quot;signal&quot; vs &quot;noise&quot; in your application.</p>

<p>My central question is how do I tell these two models apart?  Am I incorrectly fitting the first one, and I need an extra term in there to model the relationships between groups and the x variable as well as y?  Both detect substantial between group variation in the intercept and not much in the slope as I would predict.  But I need a way to tell these two apart.  Any thoughts would be helpful.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Edits:</p>

<p>This has been helpful in me restating the question.  So I want to re-ask the question with an example which I hope will make it clear why I want to be able to tell these two models apart. Let's imagine that Y is the average student test score at a school, and X is spending per student in that school.  Our grouping variables are 5 different school districts.  </p>

<p>Data in the top figure shows that an increase in spending within a district means that test scores increase.  It also shows that between districts there are differences is scores, but that's clearly because some districts spend more student than others.</p>

<p>Data in the second figure show similarly that within a district student scores increase as spending increases.  It also shows that between districts there are differences in test scores.  However we don't know what is driving those differences, unlike in the first set of data.  This is a pretty common situation I've encountered in building models.  The former is not.  </p>

<p>So what I'm asking is what is the appropriate model that captures the following features from the first dataset:</p>

<ol>
<li>Test scores increase as spending per student does</li>
<li>There is also variance between districts in student test scores</li>
<li>Part of that difference between districts is because of the underlying relationship between spending and test scores, which also varies with district.</li>
</ol>

<p>More generally stated, how do you handle a scenario where you're building a hierarchical model where the grouping variable is correlated with one of your continuous independent variables (e.g. the first scenario).  I feel like the model I've presented get's at points 1. and 2., but not point 3.  So I'm really seeking a way to tease these two scenarios apart.</p>

<p>Normally I might add an extra level of hierarchy if there was another group level explanatory variable.  Continuing our example, maybe in the 2nd dataset there are differences between district because in some districts parents have more time to spend on homework with students.  So we would add that as a group level predictor in a hierarchical model.  But that wouldn't work in the first scenario. </p>

<p>We were going through the following word problem:</p>

<p>""4 computers run continuously for the Toronto Stock Exchange. The probability of a computer failure in a day is estimated at 5%. Assuming differing computers fail independently, what is the probability that all 4 computers fail in a day?""</p>

<p>Since the sampling takes place over an interval, the way I would approach this is using the Poisson distribution, with the average number of computers failing on a day $\equiv\lambda = 0.05$. If four computers fail, then $k = 4$. Thus,
\begin{align*}
   P(k; \lambda) &amp;= \frac{\lambda^{k} e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \\
   P(k=4; \lambda = 0.05) &amp;= \frac{0.05^{4} e^{-0.05}}{4!} \\
   &amp; = 2.477\times 10^{-7}
\end{align*}</p>

<p>However, a student asked why it would not be appropriate to just multiply the probability of each computer failing. Since the probability of each computer failing each day $\equiv p = 0.05$, and since each computer failure is independent, he argued that,</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
   P(k=4) &amp;= p^4 \\
          &amp;= 0.05^4 = 6.25\times 10^{-6}

57264,633.0,2,,57262.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>The Poisson process that you're using assumes that 0.05 is the expected number of computers failing in one day in an unknown number of total computers (your answer also assumes that this rate is fixed after a computer fails, which implies that computers can fail multiple times, or are replaced immediately, or there are so many of them that this is negligible).</p>

<p>The independent probability that the student is using assumes that there are exactly four computers each of which has a 5% chance of failing.</p>

<p>The wording makes it sound to me like 5% is the chance of any individual computer failing (so the second interpretation).  In that case, we want to know the total number of computers and apply a binomial distribution.  Since the question doesn't give the total number of computers, it can't be answered.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that 5% is the probability that exactly one computer fails, and yet another possibility is that 5% is the probability that at least one computer fails.  In either case you can deduce the Poisson process intensity that gives this value.  For the first of these, I get 4.4997552907483822; for the second, I get an intensity of 0.051293294149203306.  From there you could calculate similarly to how you did.</p>

<hr>

<p>Per your update:  You can eliminate the Poisson process since you don't have a fixed rate.  You still have to decide whether 5% is the probability of a given computer failing, in which case the student is right.  If it's the probability of at least one computer failing, or the probability of exactly one computer failing, you'll have to reason back from that number to the probability of any individual computer failing before reasoning forwards.</p>

Y10 &lt;- Y10*sqrt(var(Y[,10])/var(Y10)) ## scaling to the variance of Y[,10]
Y[,10] &lt;- Y10-mean(Y10)+mean(Y[,10]) ## center

I found that results are even better with the firsts components (e.g. 1:5 for ten PC)</p>

Let's say you assume that there is a relatively stable ""churn"" from one company to another, as a linear function of their market share in the previous period. This assumption brings in a set of unknown coefficients to be estimated (which will then give you an estimate of ""hidden transfers of market share""). Write $G_{t}^{A\rightarrow B} = a_bA_{t-1}$ (market share lost from $A$ to $B$ as a linear function of $A$'s market share in period $t-1$).

<p>So you have essentially $6$ unknown coefficients and a sample of $T-1$ observations (for each company).<br>
Note that these restrictions <em>imply</em> the ""add up to unity"" restriction $A_t+B_t+C_t =1$ for each $t$, so this last one does not impose any additional structure on the unknown coefficients -but it does imply a relation between the error terms, namely that $u^A_{t} + u^B_{t}  +u^C_{t} =0$. Any additional assumptions on the three error terms should either come from knowledge of the specific real world phenomenon under study, and/or through a statistical specification search.</p>

<p>Then, an estimation for a hidden transfer of market share will be, for example</p>

<p>$$\hat G_{t}^{A\rightarrow B} = \hat \gamma_{21}A_{t-1}$$</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Of course you may find that such a model does not fit your data sample well - for example you expect that all estimated coefficients should be positive and smaller than or equal to unity, but the estimation procedure may not give you that. But this is what we do: we come up with specification hypotheses and we test them against the data - ""success"" is never guaranteed. Then you should try to come up with a different model.</p>

All participants completed both repetitions for all stages, but one group had 8 participants while the other group only had 6. I have a about 100 dependent variables that I wish to examine, so my data looks a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>ID   Group    Repetition    Stage   DV1    DV2     ...
1    A        1             1       212.9  179.9   ...

2    B        2             1       128.6  178.2   ...
</code></pre>

<p>Group is a between-subjects factor while Repetition and Stage are within-subjects factors. I would like to determine whether Group and Repetition have a significant effect on each dependent variable within each stage (I am not interested in the effect of stage itself). I'm doing the analysis in R so I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>options(contrasts=c(""contr.sum"",""contr.poly""))
mydata            = read.csv(""data.csv"",header=TRUE)
mydata$Group      = factor(mydata$Group)
mydata$Repetition = factor(mydata$Repetition)
mydata$Stage      = factor(mydata$Stage)
# for each stage
mydata = mydata[mydata$Stage==1,]
for (i in 5:(ncol(mydata))) 
{
   fit = aov(formula=as.formula(paste(names(mydata)[i],

             data=mydata)
}
</code></pre>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is mixed measures ANOVA a valid test for this data? What's the correct way to test whether my data fits the assumptions of ANOVA in R? If this is not a reliable test, what's a possible alternative?</li>

<p>Yes, in one class SVM (and any other outlier detection algorithm) you need just <strong>one</strong> class.

<p>There, my parameters are $\mu$ and $T$, and $\mathbb{x}=(x_1,\dots,x_M)$ where $x_i\in\{0,1\}$ and I have the restriction $\forall i\in\{1,\dots,M-D+1\}$
$$\sum_{j=0}^{D-1} x_{i+j} \leq 1$$
This is, $h(\mathbb{x})=0$ if that condition is not held.</p>

<p>I have the ""small"" inconvenience of not knowing $\mathcal{Z}(T,\mu)$, so I used a MCMC (Metropolis-Hastings) method to approximate this function. However I face two problems.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first of them regards the simulation and the model and I am on solving it (it depends too much on the initial condition). </p></li>

<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>Thanks to cardinal's comment, I have realized that I didn't explain one thing. It probably makes all more complex but there it goes:
The idea is that $E$ is known in each experiment, actually $E(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{x}$. However, $\mathbf{E}$ is not always the same, it represents an external potential for some particles. The ""good"" thing is that $T$, which accounts for the temperature, never changes whatever $\mathbf{E}$ is, so I thought that I could find a way of estimating it, given the fact that I have an empirical distribution of $x_{i}$ (so, a probability that a particle is in the position $i$) given a certain $\mathbf{E}$. So, in a way, what I have is
$$f(\mathbf{x}|T,\mu , \mathbf{E})$$, but I always know $\mathbf{E}$ and I know (can I say this?) that $T,\mu$ are independent of $\mathbf{E}$. I am sorry for not being clear enough before. I am starting to think that nothing of this makes sense...</p>

Clusters were made for each stratum. In each cluster: batches of 10 interviews were sampled in fixed intervals. A random walk selected households and within these households, respondents were randomly chosen.</p>

<p><em><strong>The selection probability weight:</em></strong> I had no population data on number of households. A selection probability weight was calculated for the within-household selection for each stratum.

The size of the eventual stratum was divided by the number of people in the stratum eligible for the survey. The result of this calculation was then multiplied by the number of eligible respondents in the household.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT with my personal version of the answer from @StéphaneLaurent</strong></p>

<p>I used the model he described to sample from a normal distribution with mean=0, between subject variance =1 and within subject error/variance= 0.1,1,10,100. A subset of the confidence intervals are shown in the left panels while the distribution of their widths is shown by the corresponding right panels. This has convinced me that he is 100% correct. However, I am still confused by my example above but will follow this up with a new more focused question.</p>

57318,18198.0,1,,,,Iterative method to find Ridge Regression Parameter,<ridge-regression>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I have seen a method whereby instead of trying to estimate the ridge parameter (k) directly from the data (using one of the many many ridge parameter estimators in the literature) you solve for it iteratively.</p>

<p>The method is simple enough: You simply increase k (in suitably small steps) until the condition number is reduced blow 10.  </p>

<p>At first blush this seems like quite a nice solution to me but I've never seen a Ridge Regression paper/book that uses it. </p>

<p>Update OK this is basically the method suggested by Marquardt ""Generalized inverses, Ridge Regression, Biased Linear Estimation and Non-linear Estimation"" the only difference being he used VIF's to measure the MC while this method uses the condition number. McDonald and Galrneau ""A Monte-Carlo Evaluation of some Ridge-Type Estimators"" note that this method is may not be appropriate for all data sets as it does not include the y values (observations). I still have not found a paper where the Marquardt method is tested against other estimators for the ridge parameter does anybody know of such a paper?  </p>

<p>Is this method theoretically sound though? Even if (as I suspect) it isn't does it really matter for the average practitioner who just want to produce more stable estimates of their Beta's (the weights in the regression) rather than having them ""blow up"" to grossly unrealistic values when they experience severe MC?</p>

<p>Truly I would like to find a better method than this ideally with a solid theoretical underpinning but its hard to see from a practical view point it can be improved upon?</p>

If your sample sizes are equal, you are in pretty good shape whether you want to use a pooled estimate of the variance or unpooled (Welch's test). Do a one sided test, if you are sure that the population of s1 has a mean at least as large as the mean of the population of s2.</p>

<p>Note: If the variances are much larger than the means, your counts are not Poisson. But what matters here is the distribution of the sample averages, and that should be nearly normal, unless the data are super-skewed. In that case, you could do a non-parametric test like the Kruskal-Wallis.</p>

57319,1693.0,1,,,,How high must logistic covariates' predictive accuracy be for a reversal effect to show up?,<regression><logistic><controlling-for-a-variable>,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>I am modeling an outcome for hospital patients, 'RA' (whether readmitted; 0=No, 1=Yes).  My predictor of interest is 'HHS' (whether referred to Home Health Services such as from a visiting nurse; 0=No, 1=Yes).  Those referred readmit at a 15.2% rate; others, 9.2%, but the former are needier, sicker patients.  Conventional thinking is that if we controlled for severity of illness this difference would not only be washed out but would reverse itself.  In other words, holding constant the severity of illness, having HHS should mean a lower RA rate.</p>

<p>With HHS as the sole predictor, its coefficient (B) in a <strong>logistic</strong> regression = 0.6 (N ~ 25k).  B is reduced to 0.2 with a group of covariates controlled, each accounting for some aspect of severity of illness, but B doesn't fall below zero.</p>

<p>HHS alone explains only about 1% of the variance in RA; with the other predictors, this becomes 4%.* Perhaps this is the problem--that these covariates are not explaining enough variance to ""succeed"" in reversing the sign of the coefficient of interest.  If this is true, is there a way to estimate how high <strong>their</strong> explained variance needs to be for such a reversal to show up?</p>

<p>EDIT:  Alecos Papadopoulos has come up with an impressive solution that answers this question, soon to be published in <em>The American Statistician</em>.

assuming $K$ repeated measurements for each individual. This is nothing but the one-way ANOVA model with a fixed factor.</p>

<p>And then I claimed that in order to draw inference about the $\mu_i$ you can simply consider the simple classical linear model whose observations are the subjects means $\bar y_{ij\bullet}$. <strong>Update 12/04/2014</strong>: Some examples of this idea are now written on my blog: <a href=""http://stla.github.io/stlapblog/posts/ModelReduction.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reducing a model to get confidence intervals</a>.

It starts on page 57 or you can use the table of contents button in the bottom <em>left</em> corner to find it. </p>

<p>Here's an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I]f you do nothing else, please try to remember the following
  sentence: “the $p$-value is the probability that the data would be at
  least as extreme as those observed, if the null hypothesis were true.”
  Though I’d prefer that you also understood it—about which, teeth
  brushing.</p>
  
  <p>I have three young children. In the evening, before we get to bedtime
  stories (bedtime stories being a nice way to end the day), we have to
  persuade them all to bathe, use the toilet, clean their teeth, change
  into pajamas, get their clothes ready for the next day and then
  actually get into bed (the persuading part being a nice way to go
  crazy). My five-year-old can often be found sitting on his bed, fully
  dressed, claiming to have clean teeth. The give-away is the bone dry
  toothbrush: he says that he has brushed his teeth, I tell him that he
  couldn’t have.</p>
  
  <p>My reasoning here goes like this: the toothbrush is dry; it is
  unlikely that the toothbrush would be dry if my son had cleaned his
  teeth; therefore he hasn’t cleaned his teeth. Or using
  statistician-speak: here are the data (a dry toothbrush); here is a
  hypothesis (my son has cleaned his teeth); the data would be unusual
  if the hypothesis were true, therefore we should reject the
  hypothesis. </p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>So here is what to parrot when we run into each other at a bar and I
  still haven’t managed to work out any new party tricks: “The $p$-value
  is the probability that the data would be at least as extreme as those
  observed, if the null hypothesis were true.” When I recover from
  shock, you can explain it to me in terms of a toothbrush (“The
  probability of the toothbrush being dry if you’ve just cleaned your
  teeth”).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other thing I really like about this example is that it also explains that failing to reject the null does not mean the null is necessarily true. Vickers writes that his son has now worked out the trick and has taken to running his toothbrush under the tap for a second or two before heading to bed. Just because the toothbrush is wet (and the data is consistent with the null hypothesis), it does not mean that his son has cleaned his teeth. </p>

IF both data sets are drawn from the same distribution (they describe the same problem) than you can use the labeled set as a ""test set"" for the clustering. Basically you treat the clustering algorithm as a classifier. The only problem is that you must find a match between the output of the clustering algorithm and the actual labels. </p>

<p>You might use some simple matching (ex: instances labeled GREEN are more often clustered in cluster 2 and BLUE in cluster 1 so cluster 1== BLUE and cluster 2 == GREEN).</p>

<p>More elegantly you can compute the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Mutual Information"">Mutual Information</a> between the clustering output and actual labels. Mutual Information has a nice property, that one doesn't need to know the exact matching. MI will give high scores if most of the matching are consistent. Think of it as a correlation coefficient between (cluster &lt;-> actual label) relation.</p>

<p>Also check <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis</a> for some measures. The key phrase there is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] clustering results are evaluated based on data that was not used for clustering, such as known class labels and external benchmarks. Such benchmarks consist of a set of pre-classified items, and these sets are often created by human (experts). Thus, the benchmark sets can be thought of as a gold standard for evaluation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For ROC usually one needs some ""<em>a posteriori</em>"" probability, outputted by the classifier, but in your case, the distance between the instance and the cluster center will work. Keep in mind that ROC is computed for a specific label at a time (i.e. one vs all). So for 5 labels you will get 4 independent AUROC values.</p>

<p>IMHO I strongly advise yo to do the CV for clustering if you have labeled data! Iterate it several times and use the mean of your measure as the performance. </p>

<p>I would also try this: Use some percent (66% usually) of unlabeled data to perform clustering, measure performance using labeled data, repeat the experiment with different randomization (usually 5-10 times) and report mean performance. Unfortunately I don't know if this method will give a good estimate of your real performance. Is it possible that will overfit the labeled data set. This is not a textbook approach, so, use it with caution.</p>

<p>Long story short: The same performance can be obtained for different pairs of C and kernel parameters. You shouldn't try to manually tune a SVM.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Some details:</p>

<p>I usually tune C (the cost parameter) when I have largely imbalanced classes. That is, one class have 10% and the other 90%. Some SVM libraries (esp. libSVM which I use) lets you specify a cost for each class. According to <a href=""http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/guide/guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libsvm</a> paper, $\frac{c_1}{c_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$ where $n_2&gt;n_1$ , $n_i$ is the volume of the i'th class. If you let $c_2 = 1$ then $c_1 = n_2/n_1$ . There is also a ""global"" C, that is multiplied with the specific $c_i$ values.</p>

<p>When the learning algorithm computes the error for the current SVM parameters, it multiplies each wrongly classified instance with this cost. If the cost is the same for both classes, the lesser class errors will get diluted and your final model will tend not to predict very well (or not at all) the weakly represented class.</p>

<p><strong>Gamma</strong> acts as the $\sigma$ for a Gaussian kernel $G(x) = exp(-x^2/2\sigma^2)$. Note from the equation of RBF : $K(x,y)=exp(-\gamma||x-y||^2)$  that $\gamma$ is more or less proportional to $1/\sigma^2$. Basically $\gamma$ controls the width of the kernel.</p>

<p>The intuition behind this is that a large kernel will tend to produce a smoother border between classes and a narrower kernel a more intricate border. In extreme, the former will tend to give higher bias (it learns only the general aspect of the data) and the latter will tend to overfit (it learns all the details, including the outliers and errors in the data). None of these extremes are welcome in applications. A midpoint is desired, but this midpoint cannot be computed analytically and depends on the actual data.</p>

<p>This is why, the metaparameters are usually searched through cross validation. Please keep  in mind that you must optimize for BOTH parameters in the same time.</p>

<p>The <strong>cost parameter C</strong>.</p>

<p>The theory says that SVM is a large margin classifier. In layman terms this means that it tries to find a border that is somehow as far away as possible from both classes. See the figure below (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/peYzY.png"" alt=""example of a large margin""></p>

<p>Both H2 and H3 are ok, but H3 is better because if new samples arrive, is more likely to be classified wrong by H2 than H3, because H2 crosses near the black group.</p>

<p>The math behind SVM ensures that if a border is found, this is the one gives the largest gap between the data. </p>

<p>And now the tricky part: In the data you have outliers, errors, etc. basically data that is labeled as white but resides near the black group and vice versa. You have two choices: Move the border so you minimize the number of samples that will be learned wrong OR ignore few samples here and there but ensure that the border gives you large separation between classes. </p>

<p>The cost parameter C ""tunes"" the algorithm between better fitting the available data or giving a larger margin. If I'm not mistaken, small C means that you prefer larger margin.</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>

<p>p.s. I am not an expert in SVM so I can't give you the intuition on how exactly the values for global cost parameter C actually influences the results or the convergence speed of SVM.</p>

<p>1) If you're doing a formal hypothesis test (and if you're going as far as quoting a p-value in my book you already are), <strong>what is the formal rejection rule?</strong></p>

<p>When comparing test statistics to critical values, the critical value is <em>in the rejection region</em>. While this formality doesn't matter much when everything is continuous, it does matter when the distribution of the test statistic is discrete.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, when comparing p-values and significance levels, the rule is:</p>

<p>Please note that, even if you rounded your p-value up to 0.05, indeed even if the <span class=""math-container"">$p$</span> value was exactly 0.05, formally, <em>you should still reject</em>.</p>

<p>2) In terms of 'what is our p-value telling us', then assuming you can even interpret a p-value as 'evidence against the null' (let's say that opinion on that is somewhat divided), 0.0499 and 0.0501 are not really saying different things about the data (effect sizes would tend to be almost identical).</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to (1) formally reject the null, and perhaps point out that even if it were exactly 0.05 it should still be rejected; (2) note that there's nothing particularly <em>special</em> about <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha = 0.05$</span> and it's very close to that borderline -- even a slightly smaller significance threshold would not lead to rejection.</p>

I am worried that these data are temporally autocorrelated and was trying to figure out if I need to address that. However, the only time I will be using degrees of freedom with these data is in a perMANOVA. This test calculates a pseudo F-statistic by permuting the rows. I can't figure out if the exchangebility assumption means that I don't need to worry about autocorrelation at all (i.e., permuting rows will simply destroy the temporal structure, which I am not interested in anyway) or if it means that I can't use a perMANOVA even if I accounted for autocorrelation?</p>

<p>Edit: I am editing this in the hopes that clarification will help get it answered. The perMANOVA user's guide says:</p>

<p><em>""Recall that for traditional one-way ANOVA, the assumptions are that the errors are independent, that they are normally distributed with a mean of zero and a common variance, and that the treatment effects are additive. In the case of a one-way analysis, the PERMANOVA test using permutations assumes only that the observation units are exchangeable under a true null hypothesis. There are no explicit assumptions regarding the distributions of the original variables; they are certainly not assumed to be normally distributed. However, implicit in the notion of exchangeability is the notion of independence, <strong>for if observations are correlated with one another (e.g., temporally or 
spatially), then randomly shuffling them will destroy this kind of inherent structure, if it is there.</strong> Thus, in general, we would assume that the observation units are independent of one another.""</em></p>

<p>The meaning of this is ambiguous to me for the reasons stated in the first paragraph. I can't find any techniques for testing/correcting autocorrelation with perMANOVA, which maybe means that it isn't a problem to worry about? </p>

<p>You can easily test this by specifying the initial centroids and see how things evolve!</p>

<p>For instance, R will just give you an error.</p>

<p>Say you do:</p>

<pre><code># Set the RNG seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(12345)

# Let's create 3 visually distinct clusters
n &lt;- c(1000, 500, 850)
classifier.1 &lt;- c(rnorm(n[1], 10, 0.9), 
                  rnorm(n[2], 25, 2),
                  rnorm(n[3], 35, 2))
classifier.2 &lt;- c(rnorm(n[1], 5, 1),
                  rnorm(n[2], 10, 0.4),
                  rnorm(n[3], 2, .9))

col = c(""blue"", ""darkgreen"", ""darkred"")
# Run k-means with 3 clusters and random initial centroids 
# to check the clusters are correctly recognized
km &lt;- kmeans(cbind(classifier.1, classifier.2), 3)
# Plot the data, colored by cluster
plot(classifier.1, classifier.2, pch=20, col=col[km$cluster])

# Mark the final centroids
points(km$centers, pch=20, cex=2, col=""orange"")

# Now impose some obviously ""wrong"" starting centroids
start.x &lt;- c(10, 25, 3000)
start.y &lt;- c(10, 10, -10000)
km.2 &lt;- kmeans(cbind(classifier.1, classifier.2), 
               centers=cbind(start.x, start.y))
</code></pre>

<p>Now, R has obviously no issue in discriminating the 3 clusters when you let it choose the initial centroids, but when you run it the second time it will just say:</p>

<pre><code>Error: empty cluster: try a better set of initial centers
</code></pre>

<p>I guess that if you are implementing your own algorithm you may choose to use this behaviour or rather give the user a warning and let the algorithm choose the centroids by itself.</p>

<p>Obviously, as others pointed out, there are algorithms such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B"" rel=""nofollow"">k-means++</a> that help in choosing a good set of starting centroids.</p>

<p>Also, in R you can use the <code>nstart</code> parameter of the kmeans function to run several iterations with different centroids: this will improve clustering in certain situations.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: also, note from the R <code>kmeans</code> help page</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The algorithm of Hartigan and Wong (1979) is used by default. Note
  that some authors use k-means to refer to a specific algorithm rather
  than the general method: most commonly the algorithm given by MacQueen
  (1967) but sometimes that given by Lloyd (1957) and Forgy (1965). The
  Hartigan–Wong algorithm generally does a better job than either of
  those, but trying several random starts (nstart> 1) is often
  recommended. For ease of programmatic exploration, k=1 is allowed,
  notably returning the center and withinss.</p>
  
  <p>Except for the Lloyd–Forgy method, k clusters will always be returned
  if a number is specified. If an initial matrix of centres is supplied,
  it is possible that no point will be closest to one or more centres,
  which is currently an error for the Hartigan–Wong method.</p>

<li><strong>Centering both variables at their individual mean.</strong> This has the unfortunate downside that the 0 now is at a different position for both variables considering the original variable.</li>
<li><strong>Centering both variables at the mean of the original variable</strong> (i.e., subtracting the mean from the original variable for the linear term and subtracting the square of the mean of the original variable from the quadratic term). With this approach the 0 would represent the same value of the original variable, but the quadratic variable would not be centered at 0 (i.e., the mean of the variable wouldn't be 0).</li>
</ol>

<p>I think that approach 2 seems reasonable given the reason for centering after all.  However, I cannot find anything about it (also not in the related questions: <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/67512/442"">a</a> and <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/47178/442"">b</a>).</p>

<p>Or is it generally a bad idea to include linear and quadratic terms and their interactions with other variables in a model?</p>

""These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance"".</p>

<p>Continuing with the references, as the author who introduced GARCH shows (Bollerslev, Tim (1986). ""<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304407686900631#"">Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity</a>"", Journal of Econometrics, 31:307-327)

<p>Stationarity (the one needed for estimation procedures), is defined relative to the <em>unconditional</em> distribution and moments.  </p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong><br>
To summarize here discussion in the comments, the GARCH modeling approach is an ingenious way to model suspected heteroskedasticity over time, i.e. of some form of <em>heterogeneity</em> of the process (which would render the process non-stationary) as an observed feature that comes from the existence of <em>memory</em> of the process, in essence <em>inducing</em> stationarity at the unconditional level.  </p>

<p>In other words, we took our two ""great opponents"" in stochastic process analysis (heterogeneity and memory), and used the one to neutralize the other -and this is indeed an inspired strategy.</p>

<p>1) Get the cytoband locations for all genes. These are stored in the organism specific packages, e.g., org.Dm.eg.db, and are named as 'MAP' . You might need the chiptype specific annotation package to map between the probe identifiers and the genes first. </p>

<p>2) Once you have the cytoband annotations for the genes, you can then test each cytoband separately with the functionality offered by, e.g., the topGO package. There is a section with the heading 'Predefined list of interesting genes' in the vignette of the topGO package that shortly shows how to do this is a similar case.</p>

<p>For the smoothing approach you have thought of, it might be worth correcting the counts with the actual number of genes in any predefined window, taking into account that not all genes might be present on the chip. The exact gene locations are available in the organism specific annotation package (the same as above). Some difficulties might arise, since certain locations probably have a gene in both strands, so you just need to decide how to count them.</p>

<p>A right interpretation should contain the following information:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There are two approaches to interpretating of p-values:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Frequentist interpretation, which your answer correctly used: The p-value is the probability of observing a value (in your case, the association between y-intercept and response) as extreme or more ('extreme' implies a two-tailed test), if the null hypothesis is true (in your case that is, the association between y-intercept and response is truly absent in the population, i.e. y-intercept = 0. In some tests it can mean the difference is 0);</p></li>
<li><p>or, the probability of obtaining that estimate of the parameter (e.g. intercept; using this statistical approach), or a more extreme value, if the population value for that parameter is 0.  Your definition correctly uses the frequentist form.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>As you can see from point 1, you do not need to assume the other coefficients are correct when interpreting p-values in a regression model... just that the same approach was used.  However, it does assume that those parameters are estimated.  <strong>So, your definition lacks</strong> in saying that 'first coefficient is 0.514'. All you need to assert was that the first coefficient is being estimated, i.e. '...the true value of the y-intercept is zero, <em>in the presence of x.</em>'. The values of other coefficients are immaterial to the definition of the p-value of any coefficients.</li>
<li>The y-intecept is referring to the value of y when all xs are zero. You correctly implied this point.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should also note that your example, in using the frequentist approach, is not free from your wants and subjective beliefs. Specifically, the p-value is tied to the design of the experiment you ran. You acknowledged this when you mention using the same number of sampling pairs.</p>

<p>With regards to your second question, the typical p-value reported for a regression equation is implicitly two-tailed. So, it refers to the absolute value of the parameters obtained. You didn't provide the Excel function you used to calaculate the p-value, but I'd check there to see if Excel is calculating one-tailed (in the same direction) or two-tailed (extreme or more extreme) p-values.</p>

<p>The error component of a model includes <em>all</em> sources of variability that are not explicitly included in the model. This includes sampling errors (uncertainty due to measuring only a subset of the population), measurement errors (uncertainty due to imprecisions in each measurement), and other things, like error attributable to a misspecified model (e.g., missing predictors/interactions). </p>

<p>Keep in mind that these are actually types of errors. For example, there may be measurement error associated with each variable in the model, and that error might be a combination of systematic error (essentially, a bias; e.g., someone forgot that the scale reports the weight of the container + its contents) and random error.  Given that, there isn't an automatic, all-purpose way of identifying the various error contributions. </p>

<p>One way to examine measurement errors is through <strong>calibration</strong>. For example, you could put a weight on the scale and compare the scale's reading to the known mass of the weight. In many cases, the phenomena causing measurement error are reasonably well understood and have a specific structure (e.g., <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise"">shot noise</a>), which allows them to be incorporated into the model. Some large-scale physics experiments take this to incredible extremes to compare an apparatus's expected performance to the real data. Surveys are sometimes <strong>benchmarked</strong> by comparing data collected during the survey to larger data sets. For example, you might ask participants for demographic information (e.g., age, gender, income). These values are then compared to known population values (e.g., from a census or tax records), which might tell you how representative your respondents are of the general population. </p>

<p>Sampling error is much harder to measure directly. You might expect sampling error to shrink as the number of samples approaches the size of the population, whereas a systematic measurement error would remain approximately the same, regardless of sample size. </p>

The thought experiment is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose a statistician is asked to design a model for a simple time
  series $X_1,X_2,X_3,...$ and she decides to use a Bayesian method.
  Assume she collects a first observation $X_1 = x_1$. She computes the
  posterior probability density function (pdf) over the parameters
  $\theta$ of the model given the data using Bayes’ rule: $$p(\theta|X_1
= x_1) = \int\frac{p(X_1 = x_1|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(X_1 = x_1|\theta')p(\theta')}, $$</p>
  
  <p>where $p(X_1 = x_1|θ)$ is the likelihood of $x_1$ given $\theta$ and
  p($\theta$) is the prior pdf of $\theta$. She can use the model to
  predict the next observation by drawing a sample $x_2$ from the
  predictive ￼pdf: $$p(X_2 = x_2|X_1 = x_1) = \int p(X_2 = x_2|X_1 =
 x_1,\theta)p(\theta|X_1 = x_1)d\theta,$$</p>
  
  <p>where $p(X_2 = x_2|X_1 = x_1,\theta)$ is the likelihood of $x_2$ given
  $x_1$ and $\theta$. Note that $x_2$ is not drawn from $p(X_2 = x_2|X_1
&gt; = x_1, \theta)$. She understands that the nature of $x_2$ is very different from $x_1$: while $x_1$ is informative and does change the
  belief state of the Bayesian model, $x_2$ is non-informative and thus
  is a reflection of the model’s belief state. Hence, she would never
  use $x_2$ to further condition the Bayesian model. Mathematically, she
  seems to imply that: 
  $$p(\theta|X_1 =x_1,X_2 =x_2)=p(\theta|X_1 =x_1)$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However I hardly believe that what this poor statistician should imply is:
$$p(\theta|X_1 =x_1,\text{do}(X_2 =x_2))=p(\theta|X_1 =x_1)$$

57399,6813.0,1,,,,Modelling probabilties within friend sets,<probability><modeling><binomial-distribution><model>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Recently, I was wondering about calculating the probability of a given individual in a given population ""knowing"" (let's say, present in individual's friend set) at least one person with a given trait A and at least one person with another given trait, B; where it is possible that any number of people in the given individual's friend set can possess both traits.</p>

<p>For example, using genetic traits, in a given population, how could one calculate the probability that a given individual in a given population ""knows"" at least one person with grey eye colour and at least one person who is greater than 200cm tall; where, naturally, it is possible that any number of people in the friend set can possess grey eye colour <em>and</em> be greater than 200cm tall.</p>

<p>I have developed a sort of model, but it may not be correctly specified; it is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions and Qualifications:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, for simplicity, let's assume that we define ""knowing"" as mutually connected friends on an online social network.</li>
<li>Secondly, the frequencies of genetic traits are (a) going to be determined by ethnicity of a given population as well as environmental factors (nutrition, healthcare) and (b) unlikely to be independently distributed across a given individual's friend set (e.g. family members will have greater genetic similarity); however, for this problem, let's adopt a simple model where both of the above conditions are violated.</li>
<li>Thirdly, assume that the individual's friend set provides a microcosmic representation of society; this facilitates a frequentist generation of probabilities from the instance rate in the population.</li>
<li>Finally, instances of genetic traits in the population are fabricated, but are used to generate probabilities for the examples.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Model Formulation:</strong></p>

<p>I have reasoned that a binomial random distribution can be applied to the probability of each genetic trait, where a ""success"" is defined as an individual in the friend set possessing that genetic trait.</p>

<p>Thus for trait A, we have:</p>

<p>$$P(A=k) = \binom{N}{k}p_{a}^{k}(1-p_{a})^{N-k}$$</p>

<p>and, for trait B:</p>

<p>$$P(B=k) = \binom{N}{k}p_{b}^{k}(1-p_{b})^{N-k}$$</p>

<p>where $N$ is number of friends in the friend set, $k$ is number of people containing the genetic trait and $p_{x}$ is the probability associated with possessing genetic trait $X$.</p>

<p>Because the scenario is concerned with the probability of <em>at least one</em> person possessing trait A and <em>at least one</em> person possessing trait B, it is easier to find the complement of no people in a friend set containing the trait; for both traits:</p>

<p>$$P(A &gt;= 1) = 1 - P(A = 0)$$</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>$$P(B &gt;= 1) = 1 - P(B = 0)$$</p>

<p>Furthermore, we know that probability of an intersection of events is given by:</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A|B)\mathbb{P}(B) = \mathbb{P}(B|A)\mathbb{P}(A)$$</p>

<p>However, because we are assuming independence between genetic traits, $\mathbb{P}(A)$ and $\mathbb{P}(B)$ are independent, thus:</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B)$$</p>

<p>Combining the information above, we get the following model for the above scenario:</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{P}(A &gt;=1, B &gt;=1) = \left(1-\binom{N}{k}p_{a}^{k}(1-p_{a})^{N-k}\right)\left(1-\binom{N}{k}p_{b}^{k}(1-p_{b})^{N-k}\right)$$</p>

<p>So, for the original example above, assuming a friend set of size $N = 300$, the instance of trait A in the population is $\frac{1}{800}$ and the instance of trait B in the population is $\frac{1}{5000}$; according to the model, we get the final probability:</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{P}(A &gt;=1, B &gt;=1)$$</p>

<p>$$ = \left(1-\binom{300}{0}\left(\frac{1}{800}\right)^{0}\left(\frac{799}{800}\right)^{300}\right)\left(1-\binom{300}{0}\left(\frac{1}{5000}\right)^{0}\left(\frac{4999}{5000}\right)^{300}\right)$$</p>

<p>$$\approx 0.018 = 1.8\%$$</p>

<p>Does this model seem reasonable given the assumptions?</p>

<p>Assuming this model is <em>not</em> correctly specified, maybe somebody could provide a more accurate representation.</p>

<p>y = </p>

<pre><code>[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

<p>So the length of your input layer is given by $n$, the length of your output layer is given by $h$, where your first input neuron is $x_{t-1}$ and your last input in $x_{t-n}$. Same goes for the forecast horizon.</p>

<p>Instead of having multiple outputs for the forecast horizon, you can use a forecast horizon of 1 then recurse on the predictions to obtain any forecast horizon you want.</p>

<p>For classic parametric stationary time series models the limit of the recursive behaviour of the system is well-studied.</p>

<p>Your problem is a little more involved though. You have inputs and outputs of the system and you want the predict outputs to follow some reference trajectory.</p>

<p>One solution is to use Narma-L2, which approximates the system by linear feedback using two neural networks. Define control inputs to be $c$ and production outputs to be $p$. Define reference production outputs to be $r$</p>

<p>You train two neural networks of the forms $g(c_{t-1}, .., c_{t-n}, p_{t-1},..,p_{t-n}) = c_{t}$ and $k(c_{t-1}, .., c_{t-n}, p_{t-1},..,p_{t-n}) = p_{t}$.</p>

<p>The prediction for control inputs is then $c_t = \frac{r - k(c_{t-1}, .., c_{t-n}, p_{t-1},..,p_{t-n})}{g(c_{t-1}, .., c_{t-n}, p_{t-1},..,p_{t-n})}$</p>

<p>Also, neural networks are a PITA. There's plenty of good nonparametric regression models that are easier to train, like Gaussian Process Regression for instance.</p>

examine the correlation between the spatial distribution of animals (position in space) with, for example, their genetic relatedness, rate of aggression or some other attribute. Plenty of good journals are using it (<em>PNAS, Animal Behaviour, Molecular Ecology...</em>). </p>

<p>I fabricated some patterns which may occur in nature, but Mantel's test <strong>seems to be quite useless to detect them.</strong> On the other hand, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran%27s_I"" rel=""noreferrer"">Moran's I</a> had better results <em>(see p-values under each plot)</em>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Imagine this situation:</em></strong> There is an orchard (17 x 17 trees) with a crow is sitting on each tree. Levels of ""noise"" for each crow are available and you are want to know if the spatial distribution of crows is determined by noise they make.</p>

<p><strong><em>There are (at least) 5 possibilities:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>""Birds of a feather flock together.""</strong> The more similar crows are, the smaller the geographical distance between them <strong>(single cluster)</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>""Birds of a feather flock together.""</strong> Again, the more similar crows are, the smaller the geographical distance between them, <strong>(multiple clusters)</strong> but one cluster of noisy crows has no knowledge about the existence of second cluster (otherwise they would fuse into one big cluster).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>""Monotonic trend.""</strong> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>""Opposites attract.""</strong> Similar crows cannot stand each other.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>""Random pattern.""</strong> The level of noise has no significant effect on spatial distribution.</p></li>

<p>For each case, I created a plot of points and used the Mantel test to compute a correlation (it is no surprise that its results are non-significant, I would never try to find linear association among such patterns of points).</p>

You have write:</p>

<p>I think that <strong>such hypothesis could NOT be tested by Mantel test</strong>. On both plots the hypothesis valid. But if you suppose that one cluster of not noisy crows may not have knowledge about the existence of second cluster of not noisy crows - Mantels test is again useless.

57406,22507.0,2,,20234.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Machine learning often deals with optimization of a function which has many local minimas. Feedforward neural networks with hidden units is a good example. Whether these functions are discrete or continuous, there is no method which achieves a global minimum and stops. It is easy to prove that there is no general algorithm to find a global minimum of a continuous function even if it is one-dimensional and smooth (has infinitely many derivatives).  In practice, all algorithms for learning neural networks stuck into a local minimum.  It is easy to check this: create a random neural network, make a big set of its responses to random inputs, then try to learn another neural network with the same architecture to copy the responses.  While the perfect solution exists, neither backpropagation not any other learning algorithm will be able to discover it, starting from a random set of weights.</p>

<p>Some learning methods, like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms, explore many local minimas.  For continuous functions there are methods like gradient descent, which  find the closest local minimum.  They are much faster, thats why they are widely used in practice.  But given enough time, the former group of methods outperforms the later in terms of training set error.  But with reasonable time constraints, for real world problems, the latter group is usually better.</p>

<p>For some models, like logistic regression, there is one local minimum, the function is convex, the minimization converges to the minimum, but the models themselves are simplistic.</p>

<p>Thats the bitter truth.</p>

<p>Note also that proof of convergence and proof of convergence to the best solution are two different things.  K-means algorithm is an example of this. </p>

57411,20473.0,2,,57410.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Entropy (joint entropy included), <em>is a property of the distribution</em> that a random variable follows. The available sample (and hence the timing of observation) plays no role in it.  </p>

<p>Copying for Cover &amp; Thomas, the joint entropy $H(X,Y)$ of two discrete random variables $X, Y,$ with joint distribution $p(x,y)$, is defined as</p>

<p>$$H(X,Y) = - \sum_{S_X}\sum_{S_Y}p(x,y)\log p(x,y) $$</p>

<p>Examine the expression: the sums are taken over <em>all possible values</em> of $X$ and $Y$, i.e. over all the values that belong to the support of each r.v. ($S_X$ and $S_Y$ respectively), irrespective of whether some of these values may not materialize or be observed in a sample. What we actually observe, or when, plays no role, in calculating entropy, and joint entropy in particular.  </p>

<p>Turning to your specific example: The side of a coin itself can not be modeled as a random variable. A random variable maps <em>events</em> into real numbers. The side of a coin is not an event. <em>Observing</em> one of the two sides is an event.  <em>Not observing</em> a side, is an event. So let's define a random variable $X$ by ""$X$ takes the value $1$ if heads is observed, $0$ otherwise"". And define $Y$ by ""$Y$ takes the value $1$ if tails is observed, $0$ otherwise"". Assume the coin is fair. The joint distribution of these two random variables is then described by 
$$\begin{align}
P(X=1,Y=1) &amp;= 0 \\
P(X=1,Y=0) &amp;= 0.5 \\
P(X=0,Y=1) &amp;= 0.5 \\
P(X=0,Y=0) &amp;= 0
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Note that the numerical mapping we chose (the zero/one values) does not play, as numbers go, any decisive part in the probabilities assigned -we could have chosen a 5/6 mapping for $X$ and a 56/89 mapping for $Y$ (or whatever) -the allocation of probabilities in the joint distribution would have been the same (it is the underlying structure of <em>events</em> that is the critical factor).<br>
Next, as always, we consider the distribution at non-zero values, so </p>

<p>$$H(X,Y) = - 0.5\log(0.5) - 0.5\log(0.5) $$</p>

<p>and using base-2 for the logarithm we get</p>

<p>$$H(X,Y) = - 0.5(-1) - 0.5(-1) = 1 $$</p>

<p>Finally, you can easily find that the entropy of $X$ (and likewise for $Y$) is 
$$H(X) = - \sum_{S_X}p(x)\log p(x) = - 0.5(-1) - 0.5(-1) = 1 $$</p>

<p>So in this case $H(X,Y) = H(X) = H(Y)$. But the general expression for the decomposition of joint entropy is </p>

<p>$$H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y\mid X) = H(Y) + H(X\mid Y)$$ </p>

<p>where $H(Y\mid X)$ and  $H(X\mid Y)$ are conditional entropies. Then we conclude that $H(Y\mid X) = H(X\mid Y) = 0$ in this case. The intuition is straightforward: given $X$ what has happened to $Y$ is certain (and likewise in reverse), so conditional entropy is zero.</p>

57412,22665.0,1,,,,Understanding Bayesian Predictive Distributions,<bayesian><prediction>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I'm taking an Intro to Bayes course and I'm having some difficulty understanding predictive distributions. I understand why they are useful and I'm familiar with the definition, but there are some things I don't quite understand. </p>

<p><strong>1) How to get the right predictive distribution for a vector of new observations</strong></p>

<p>Suppose that we have built a sampling model $p(y_i | \theta)$ for the data and a prior $p(\theta)$. Assume that the observations $y_i$ are conditionally independent given $\theta$. </p>

<p>We have observed some data $\mathcal{D} = \{y_1, y_2, \, ... \, , y_k\}$, and we update our prior $p(\theta)$ to the posterior $p(\theta | \mathcal{D})$. </p>

<p>If we wanted to predict a vector of new observations $\mathcal{N} = \{\tilde{y}_1, \tilde{y}_2, \, ... \, , \tilde{y}_n\}$, I think we should try to get the posterior predictive using this formula
$$
p(\mathcal{N} | \mathcal{D}) = \int p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) p ( \mathcal{N} | \theta) \, \mathrm{d} \theta = \int p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) \prod_{i=1}^n p(\tilde{y}_i | \theta) \, \mathrm{d} \theta,
$$
which is not equal to
$$
\prod_{i=1}^n  \int p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) p(\tilde{y}_i | \theta) \, \mathrm{d} \theta,
$$
so the predicted observations are not independent, right?</p>

<p>Say that $\theta | \mathcal{D} \sim$ Beta($a,b$) and $p(y_i | \theta) \sim$ Binomial($n, \theta$) for a fixed $n$. In this case, if I wanted to simulate 6 new $\tilde{y}$, if I understand this correctly, it would be wrong to simulate 6 draws independently from the Beta-Binomial distribution that corresponds to the posterior predictive for a single observation. Is this correct? I don't know how to interpret that the observations are not independent marginally, and I'm not sure I understand this correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Simulating from posterior predictives</strong></p>

<p>Many times when we simulate data from the posterior predictive we follow this scheme:</p>

<p>For $b$ from 1 to $B$:</p>

<p>1) Sample $\theta^{(b)}$ from $p(\theta | \mathcal{D})$.</p>

<p>2) Then simulate new data $\mathcal{N}^{(b)}$ from $p(\mathcal{N} | \theta^{(b)})$. </p>

<p>I don't quite know how to prove this scheme works, although it looks intuitive. Also, does this have a name? I tried to look up a justification and I tried different names, but I had no luck.</p>

<p>I have a data series showing a pretty obvious trend although it's quite noisy. I can take pretty much any division of the data and run classical tests to show a highly significant difference in means.</p>

<p>I decided to have a look at time series analysis to see if it could help describe the trend. An ARIMA(0,1,1) model comes out with AIC,BIC=34.3,37.3 (Stata), whilst an ARIMA(0,1,0) model comes out with AIC,BIC=55.1,58.1 - so I understand I'm supposed to prefer the (0,1,1) model.</p>

<p>However, the coefficient for the MA(1) is displaying as -0.9999997 (and not showing any p-values). If I try the same in SPSS I get an MA(1) coefficient of 1.000 (I assume SPSS uses opposite signs) with a p-value of 0.990 - does this mean it suggests I drop the term?</p>

<p>My understanding is that the effect of a MA(1) coefficient of -1 is basically to remove the old error term and convert the whole series to a linear trend. Does this mean ARIMA is totally unsuitable for my needs? On the plus side it gives me a sensible value for the trend. If I use the (0,1,0) model then I still get a reasonable value for the trend but it's not significant any more.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>EDIT:
Thanks for looking in. The trend looks like a fairly linear decrease; the data points seen to fairly noisily rattle around above and below a trend line. The ARIMA (0,1,1) model produces something that's not far off a straight line decrease which seems sensible - the (0,1,1) produces what is essentially a lagged version of the data, translated down by one month of trend.
The data aren't stationary (due to the trend) - though the first differences seem to be. I don't think the (0,1,1) is a bad model - I'm just a little confused by the p-value seeming to suggest I should drop the MA term - or wondering if it means I should bin ARIMA entirely!</p>

<p>I'm trying to find the ""best"" parameters in terms of student performance.  The 5-tuple represents:</p>

<ol>
<li>$b$: The ""base"" waiting time before seeing a problem again.</li>
<li>$p_1$: A constant factor if the student says the problem was easy.</li>
<li>$p_2$: A constant factor if the student says it was hard.</li>
<li>$p_3$: A constant factor if the student says it was ""normal"".</li>
<li>$p_4$: A constant factor if the student got it wrong.</li>
</ol>

<p>The waiting time for the next viewing is computed by multiplying all of the responses the student has issued, and the base waiting time, and computing $e^{b \prod p_{i,j}}$.  So, for example, a wrong answer makes the waiting time much shorter.  An 'easy' report makes it quite a bit longer.</p>

<p>Now, if the student gets the next viewing wrong, we want to count it as a failure.  If the student gets it right (regardless of the difficulty the student reports), we count it as a success.</p>

<p>I want to maximize the utility function $\frac{|\text{success}|}{|\text{total}|}$ by varying the 5-tuple.  I guess $\frac{|\text{success}|}{|\text{failure}|}$ would serve the same purpose.</p>

Verify that the model parameters are constant over time and then search for change points in error variance as he recommends.</p>

<p>Edited to respond to Nick ..</p>

<p>As you may know ARCH/GARCH concerns itself with developing an ARIMA model for the squared residuals. The problem is if you have unusual (one-time) anomalies these are dealt with by incorporating pulse indicator series, yielding a zero residual for each identified point. Squaring these residuals leads to a distribution that has long tails and is not amenable to ARIMA. When I programmed and implemented ARCH/GARCH so that I could jump on the ""next new thing"" I found that it was fundamentally inconsistent with Intervention Detection schemes. Essentially ARCH/GARCH provides a possible solution for a ""change in variance"" that may well be more easily handled by Intervention Detection (violations in the expected value). Thus at this point in time my preferences (Occam's Razor) for the simplest solution/transformation/drug/remedy causes me to keep the solution as simple as possible but not too simple. The current release of AUTOBOX treats variance heterogeneity by identifying anomalies, parameter changes and deterministic variance changes and no need for power transformations via Box-Cox... If all this fails the user can square the residuals and build an arima model to construct his/her own ARCH/GARCH model. Here I stand, I can do no other!</p>

Then given an observation sequence $O$ you have
$$

P(HHM1|O) &amp;= \frac{P(O|HMM1)P(HMM1)}{P(O)} \\

Sometimes this is necessary (like in lots of NLP applications). However, it seems like you have a priori assumed that only the last 5 observations are relevant for predicting the event of interest. If this assumption is realistic then you may have significantly more luck using traditional techniques (logistic regression, naive bayes, SVM, etc) and simply using the last 5 observations as features/independent variables. Typically these types of models will be easier to train and (in my experience) produce better results.</p>

<p>The end purpose it to print a set of shapes (wires, gates, etc) on a VLSI circuit that matches the designed shapes (a.k.a. targets) as well as possible. The measure of fitness of the manufactured set of shapes is the MAXIMAL difference from the target, rather than the $\sigma$ along the $~10^9$ location. The reason for evaluating the maximum difference is clear: a single short circuit is bad enough to bring down the entire chip, and then it wouldn't matter how close you were to the target in the remaining 99.999999% of the chip's location. </p>

<p>The problem is that it's very costly to measure the printed shape in too many locations: you literally need to look though an electron microscope at the half-manufactured chip (that's going to get trashed after the destructive measurements), adjust for metrology errors, etc. Therefore more than $10^4$ measurements is hardly ever being done. The result of those measurement is the maximal target difference $X_s$ of the SAMPLE, as well as any other sample statistics you may wish for.</p>

<p>And now one needs to estimate the maximal difference $X_p$ for the entire population... And now one wishes that he paid more attention in the statistics class back in college...</p>

If the projection is in the yellow sector then both $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are positive, but if the projection is in either the red or the blue sector then we have what appears to be suppression; that is, the sign of one of the regression weights is opposite to the sign of the corresponding simple correlation with $Y$. In the picture, $\beta_1$ is positive and $\beta_2$ is negative.</p>

<p>If $X \sim U[a,b]$ (uniform, either discrete or continuous), then the MLE estimator for b (which is $\max_{x \in [a,b]} X$) is essentially $\max_{i=1,...,N_s}x_i$.</p>

<p>I chose uniform distribution because it is the worst case distribution in terms of entropy. This is in line with the MaxEnt (maximum entropy) principle. I also assumed a linear order in the values of the random variable.</p>

<p>We can make the following claim about the estimator $\max_{i=1,...,N_s}x_i$ to <em>its</em> mean using Hoeffdings inequality (without assuming that $X \sim U[a,b]$). Assuming $x_i$ are i.i.d from some distribution with bounded support $[a,b]$, we have
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}_{x_1,...,x_{N_s}}\left(|\max_{i=1,...,N_s}x_i - \mathbb{E}[\max_{i=1,...,N_s}x_i]| \geq \epsilon\right) \leq 2\exp\left(\frac{-2\epsilon^2}{N_s(b-a)}\right)
\end{align*}
Here we do not need to know $b$ exactly, any rough or crude upper bound will suffice. The above concentration is only saying that the estimator is close to the expected value of the estimator which is not the same as being close to the unknown $\max_{x \in [a,b]}X = b$.</p>

<p>If you have additional missing data after log transformation, it is likely that you have data that is less than or equal to zero. (i.e., log(0), log(-1), etc. is not defined).

You might also like this <a href=""http://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?v=8&amp;n=6"" rel=""nofollow"">discussion of issues surrounding transformations</a>. In general, if a log transformation is flipping the direction of your skewness, then there is a good chance that you did not have very much skewness to begin with. To test whether the transformation makes a substantive difference with the context of multiple regression, examine your correlations, R-squares, and standardised betas before and after transformation, and see what changes you observed. In many cases you will see that it makes little difference.</p>

<p>Another point, is that the assumption pertains to the residuals of a multiple regression and not the dependent variable itself.</p>

<p>If you really care about optimising the transformation to make the variable approximate a normal distribution, then you can use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_transform"" rel=""nofollow"">Box-Cox transformation</a>.

<p>In summary: the correct term:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TUqrV.png"" alt=""annotated se formula""></p>

<p>$\color{red}{(1)}$ has $\sigma^2/n$ terms because we're looking at averages and that's the variance of an average of independent random variables;</p>

<p>$\color{red}{(2)}$ has a $+$ because the two samples are independent, so their variances (of the averages) add; and</p>

<p>$\color{red}{(3)}$ has a square root because we want the standard deviation of the distribution of the difference in sample means (the standard error of the difference in means). The part under the bar of the square root is the variance of the difference (the square of the standard error). Taking square roots of squared standard errors gives us standard errors. </p>

<p>The reason why we don't just add standard errors is <em>standard errors don't add</em> - the standard error of the difference in means is NOT the sum of the standard errors of the sample means for independent samples - the sum will always be too large. The variances <em>do</em> add, though, so we can use that to work out the standard errors.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's some intuition about why it's not standard deviations that add, rather than variances.</p>

<p>To make things a little simpler, just consider <em>adding</em> random variables.</p>

<p>If $Z = X+Y$, why is $\sigma_Z &lt; \sigma_X+\sigma_Y$?</p>

<p>Imagine $Y = kX$ (for $k\neq 0$); that is, $X$ and $Y$ are perfectly linearly dependent. That is, they always 'move together' in the same direction and in proportion.</p>

A simple thing to do is to combine multiple kernels as a linear combination to describe your time series properly. So I'd like to include both the squared exponential kernel and the periodic kernel. Linear combinations of valid kernels produce valid kernels, and same goes for multiplying valid kernels (given by Rasmussen and Williams).</p>

<p>Unfortunately I haven't figured out how to give the theta parameters properly to the model. For example, if we have:</p>

<p>$$
k_{Gauss}(x,x') = \exp{(\theta (x-x')^2)}

<p>then it is impossible, it seems. The $\mathbf{\theta}$ thing is supposed to be an array, in case you have multiple dimensions/features (even though scikit-learn doesn't support multidimensional GPs, someone developed it, and it will be merged soon). So there is one row with the columns being the parameter in such-and-such dimension. But you cannot have more rows, otherwise it screams at you.</p>

<p>So question: has anyone actually been able to use kernels that use more than one hyperparameter? If so, what am I doing wrong?

where $\bar{\rho}$ is the <em>average value</em> of the $\binom{n}{2}$correlation coefficients.
But since $\operatorname{var}\left(\sum_i X_i\right) \geq 0$, 
we readily get from
$(1)$ that 
$$\bar{\rho} \geq -\frac{1}{n-1}.$$</p>

<p>So, the average value of a correlation coefficient is

have the <em>same</em> value $\rho$, then their average also
equals $\rho$ and so we have that 
$$\rho \geq -\frac{1}{n-1}.$$
Is it possible to have random variables for which the common
correlation value $\rho$  <em>equals</em>
$-\frac{1}{n-1}$? Yes.  Suppose that the $X_i$ are <em>uncorrelated</em> 
unit-variance random variables  and set
$Y_i = X_i - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n  X_j = X_i -\bar{X}$. Then, $E[Y_i]=0$, while
$$\displaystyle \operatorname{var}(Y_i) 
= \left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^2 + (n-1)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2
= \frac{n-1}{n}$$ 
and
$$\operatorname{cov}(Y_i,Y_j) = -2\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) +
(n-2)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 = -\frac{1}{n}$$
giving 
$$\rho_{Y_i,Y_j} 
= \frac{\operatorname{cov}(Y_i,Y_j)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{var}(Y_i)\operatorname{var}(Y_j)}}
=\frac{-1/n}{(n-1)/n} 
= -\frac{1}{n-1}.$$
Thus the $Y_i$ are random variables achieving the minimum common
correlation value of $-\frac{1}{n-1}$. Note, incidentally, that
$\sum_i Y_i = 0$, and so, regarded as vectors, the random variables
lie in a $(n-1)$-dimensional hyperplane of $n$-dimensional space.</p>

<p>To show there is nothing especially deep or mysterious about the result, this answer first presents a completely elementary solution, requiring only the obvious fact that variances--being the expected values of squares--must be non-negative.  This is followed by a general solution (which uses slightly more sophisticated algebraic facts).</p>

<h2>Elementary solution</h2>

<p><strong>The variance of any linear combination of $x,y,z$ must be non-negative.</strong>  Let the variances of these variables be $\sigma^2, \tau^2,$ and $\upsilon^2$, respectively.  All are nonzero (for otherwise some of the correlations would not be defined).  Using the basic properties of variances we may compute</p>

<p>for all real numbers $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$.</p>

<p>Assuming $\alpha+\beta+\gamma\ne 0$, a little algebraic manipulation implies this is equivalent to</p>

<p>$$\frac{-\rho}{1-\rho} \le \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{\sqrt{(\alpha^2+\beta^2+\gamma^2)/3}}{(\alpha+\beta+\gamma)/3}\right)^2.$$</p>

<p>The squared term on the right hand side is the ratio of two power means of $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$.  The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_mean#Inequality_between_any_two_power_means"" rel=""noreferrer"">elementary power-mean inequality</a> (with weights $(1/3, 1/3, 1/3)$) asserts that ratio cannot exceed $1$ (and will equal $1$ when $\alpha=\beta=\gamma\ne 0$).  A little more algebra then implies</p>

<p>$$\rho \ge -1/2.$$</p>

<p>The explicit example of $n=3$ below (involving trivariate Normal variables $(x,y,z)$) shows that all such values, $-1/2 \le \rho \le 1$, actually do arise as correlations.  This example uses only the definition of multivariate Normals, but otherwise invokes no results of Calculus or Linear Algebra.</p>

<h2>General solution</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Any correlation matrix is the covariance matrix of the standardized random variables, whence--like all correlation matrices--it must be positive semi-definite.  Equivalently, its eigenvalues are non-negative.  This imposes a simple condition on $\rho$: it must not be any less than $-1/2$ (and of course cannot exceed $1$).  Conversely, any such $\rho$ actually corresponds to the correlation matrix of some trivariate distribution, proving these bounds are the tightest possible.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Derivation of the conditions on $\rho$</h3>

<p>Consider the $n$ by $n$ correlation matrix with all off-diagonal values equal to $\rho.$ (The question concerns the case $n=3,$ but this generalization is no more difficult to analyze.)  Let's call it $\mathbb{C}(\rho, n).$  By definition, $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of provided there exists a nonzero vector $\mathbf{x}_\lambda$ such that</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{C}(\rho,n) \mathbf{x}_\lambda = \lambda \mathbf{x}_\lambda.$$</p>

<p>These eigenvalues are easy to find in the present case, because </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Letting $\mathbf{1} = (1, 1, \ldots, 1)'$, compute that</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{C}(\rho,n)\mathbf{1} = (1+(n-1)\rho)\mathbf{1}.$$</p></li>
<li><p>Letting $\mathbf{y}_j = (-1, 0, \ldots, 0, 1, 0, \ldots, 0)$ with a $1$ only in the $j^\text{th}$ place (for $j = 2, 3, \ldots, n$), compute that</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{C}(\rho,n)\mathbf{y}_j = (1-\rho)\mathbf{y}_j.$$</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Because the $n$ eigenvectors found so far span the full $n$ dimensional space (proof: an easy row reduction shows the absolute value of their determinant equals $n$, which is nonzero), they constitute a basis of <em>all</em> the eigenvectors.  We have therefore found all the eigenvalues and determined they are either $1+(n-1)\rho$ or $1-\rho$ (the latter with multiplicity $n-1$).  In addition to the well-known inequality $-1 \le \rho \le 1$ satisfied by all correlations, non-negativity of the first eigenvalue further implies</p>

<p>$$\rho \ge -\frac{1}{n-1}$$</p>

<p>while the non-negativity of the second eigenvalue imposes no new conditions.</p>

<h3>Proof of sufficiency of the conditions</h3>

<p>The implications work in both directions: provided $-1/(n-1)\le \rho \le 1,$ the matrix $\mathbb{C}(\rho, n)$ is nonnegative-definite and therefore is a valid correlation matrix.  It is, for instance, the correlation matrix for a multinormal distribution.  Specifically, write</p>

<p>$$\Sigma(\rho, n) = (1 + (n-1)\rho)\mathbb{I}_n - \frac{\rho}{(1-\rho)(1+(n-1)\rho)}\mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}'$$</p>

<p>for the inverse of $\mathbb{C}(\rho, n)$ when $-1/(n-1) \lt \rho \lt 1.$  For example, when $n=3$</p>

<p>$$\color{gray}{\Sigma(\rho, 3) = \frac{1}{(1-\rho)(1+2\rho)} \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 \rho +1 &amp; -\rho  &amp; -\rho  \\
 -\rho  &amp; \rho +1 &amp; -\rho  \\
 -\rho  &amp; -\rho  &amp; \rho +1 \\
\end{array}
\right)}.$$</p>

<p>Let the vector of random variables $(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)$ have distribution function</p>

<p>$$f_{\rho, n}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{x}\Sigma(\rho, n)\mathbf{x}'\right)}{(2\pi)^{n/2}\left((1-\rho)^{n-1}(1+(n-1)\rho)\right)^{1/2}}$$</p>

<p>where $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$. For example, when $n=3$ this equals</p>

<p>$$\color{gray}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{3}(1-\rho)^2(1+2\rho)}}
\exp\left(-\frac{(1+\rho)(x^2+y^2+z^2) - 2\rho(xy+yz+zx)}{2(1-\rho)(1+2\rho)}\right)}.$$</p>

<p>The correlation matrix for these $n$ random variables is $\mathbb{C}(\rho, n).$</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fm2r6.png"" alt=""Figure""></p>

<p><em>Contours of the density functions $f_{\rho,3}.$  From left to right, $\rho=-4/10, 0, 4/10, 8/10$.  Note how the density shifts from being concentrated near the plane $x+y+z=0$ to being concentrated near the line $x=y=z$.</em></p>

<p>The special cases $\rho = -1/(n-1)$ and $\rho = 1$ can also be realized by <em>degenerate</em> distributions; I won't go into the details except to point out that in the former case the distribution can be considered supported on the hyperplane $\mathbf{x}.\mathbf{1}=0$, where it is a sum of identically distributed mean-$0$ Normal distribution, while in the latter case (perfect positive correlation) it is supported on the line generated by $\mathbf{1}'$, where it has a mean-$0$ Normal distribution.</p>

<hr>

<h3>More about non-degeneracy</h3>

<p>A review of this analysis makes it clear that the correlation matrix $\mathbb{C}(-1/(n-1), n)$ has a rank of $n-1$ and $\mathbb{C}(1, n)$ has a rank of $1$ (because only one eigenvector has a nonzero eigenvalue).  For $n\ge 2$, this makes the correlation matrix degenerate in either case.  Otherwise, the existence of its inverse $\Sigma(\rho, n)$ proves it is nondegenerate.</p>

<p>Assumed audience is researchers and graduate-level students. It needs to include the material of Greene's <em>Econometric Analysis</em> and Wooldridge's <em>Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data</em> in a denser form (without discussions and proofs), as well as mainstream techniques not mentioned in these two books.</p>

57493,3183.0,2,,57472.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>It sounds like your question has two parts: the underlying idea and a concrete example.  I'll start with the underlying idea, then link to an example at the bottom.</p>
<hr />
<p>EM is useful in Catch-22 situations where it seems like you need to know <span class=""math-container"">$A$</span> before you can calculate <span class=""math-container"">$B$</span> and you need to know <span class=""math-container"">$B$</span> before you can calculate <span class=""math-container"">$A$</span>.</p>
<p>The most common case people deal with is probably mixture distributions. For our example, let's look at a simple Gaussian mixture model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have two different univariate Gaussian distributions with different means and unit variance.</p>
<p>You have a bunch of data points, but you're not sure which points came from which distribution, and you're also not sure about the means of the two distributions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now you're stuck:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you knew the true means, you could figure out which data points came from which Gaussian.  For example, if a data point had a very high value, it probably came from the distribution with the higher mean.  But you don't know what the means are, so this won't work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you knew which distribution each point came from, then you could estimate the two distributions' means using the sample means of the relevant points.  But you don't actually know which points to assign to which distribution, so this won't work either.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So neither approach seems like it works: you'd need to know the answer before you can find the answer, and you're stuck.</p>
<p><em><strong>What EM lets you do is alternate between these two tractable steps instead of tackling the whole process at once.</strong></em></p>
<p>You'll need to start with a guess about the two means (although your guess doesn't necessarily have to be very accurate, you do need to start somewhere).</p>
<p>If your guess about the means was accurate, then you'd have enough information to carry out the step in my first bullet point above, and you could (probabilistically) assign each data point to one of the two Gaussians.  Even though we know our guess is wrong, let's try this anyway. And then, given each point's assigned distributions, you could get new estimates for the means using the second bullet point. It turns out that, each time you do loop through these two steps, you're improving a lower bound on the model's likelihood.</p>
<p>That's already pretty cool: even though the two suggestions in the bullet points above didn't seem like they'd work individually, you can still use them together to improve the model.  The <em><strong>real</strong></em> magic of EM is that, after enough iterations, the lower bound will be so high that there won't be any space between it and the local maximum.  As a result, and you've locally optimized the likelihood.</p>
<p>So you haven't just <em>improved</em> the model, you've found the <em>best</em> possible model one can find with incremental updates.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Em_old_faithful.gif"" rel=""noreferrer"">This</a> page from Wikipedia shows a slightly more complicated example (two-dimensional Gaussians and unknown covariance), but the basic idea is the same.  It also includes well-commented <code>R</code> code for implementing the example.</p>
<p>In the code, the &quot;Expectation&quot; step (E-step) corresponds to my first bullet point: figuring out which Gaussian gets responsibility for each data point, given the current parameters for each Gaussian.  The &quot;Maximization&quot; step (M-step) updates the means and covariances, given these assignments, as in my second bullet point.</p>
<p>As you can see in the animation, these updates quickly allow the algorithm to go from a set of terrible estimates to a set of very good ones: there really do seem to be two clouds of points centered on the two Gaussian distributions that EM finds.</p>

57494,155.0,2,,57473.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<h3>Algebraic intuition</h3>

<p>The standard error of the mean for $n$ independent observations is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.</p>

<p>So if we have two independent samples we have the standard errors for the means of group 1 and group 2.</p>

<p>$$\sigma_{\mu_1}=\frac{\sigma_1}{\sqrt{n_1}}$$
$$\sigma_{\mu_2}=\frac{\sigma_2}{\sqrt{n_2}}$$</p>

<p>If we square these values we get the variance of the mean:</p>

<p>$$\sigma^2_{\mu_1}=\frac{\sigma^2_1}{n_1}$$
$$\sigma^2_{\mu_2}=\frac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2}$$</p>

<p>The variance of the sum or difference of two independent random variables 
is the sum of the two variances. Thus,</p>

<p>$$\sigma^2_{\mu_1 - \mu_2} =\sigma^2_{\mu_1} + \sigma^2_{\mu_2} =  \frac{\sigma^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2} $$ </p>

<p>So if we want the standard error of the difference we take the square root of the variance:</p>

<p>$$\sigma_{\mu_1 - \mu_2} =\sqrt{\sigma^2_{\mu_1} + \sigma^2_{\mu_2}} =  \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2}} $$ </p>

<p>So I imagine this is intuitive if the component steps are intuitive. In particular it helps if you find intuitive the idea that the variance of the sum of independent variables is the sum of the variances of the component variables.</p>

<h3>Fuzzy Intuition</h3>

<p>In terms of more general intuition, if $n_1 = n_2$ and $\sigma=\sigma_1=\sigma_2$ then the standard error of the difference between means will be $\sqrt{2}\sigma_\mu\approx 1.4\times \sigma_\mu$. It makes sense that this value of approximately 1.4 is greater than 1 (i.e., the variance of a variable after adding a constant; i.e., equivalent to one sample t-test) and less than 2 (i.e., the standard deviation of the sum of two perfectly correlated variables (with equal variance) and the standard error implied by the formula you mention: $\frac{\sigma_1}{\sqrt{n_1}} + \frac{\sigma_2}{\sqrt{n_2}}$).</p>

I have collected this data for 8 years. </p>

<p>My objective is to forecast $Y(t)$ ahead by 1,2,3,...,365 days. I expect long-run forecasts to be different to short-run forecasts.

<p>Since the population is sufficiently small that $\Delta Y(t+k)$ is typically in $\{-2,-1,0,1,2\}$ for the forecasting horizon under question, I will use a multiple categorical response variable classification model that will assign probabilities to the various class labels being observed.</p>

<p>In these situations, the method I have come to prefer for trimming random terms is not to rely on significance tests or likelihood ratios, but rather to just identify the random effects that seem to have the smallest standard deviations (which can admittedly be a little tricky when predictors are on very different scales, but I try to take account of this in my appraisal) and remove these terms first, sequentially in an iterative process. The idea being that I want to alter the predictions of the model as little as possible while still reducing the complexity of the model.</p>
<p>One pattern that I seem to have noticed after a pretty good amount of time spent doing this is that following this method very often leads me to trim random effects associated with higher-order terms (as defined above) of the model first. This is not always true, and occasionally some of the higher-order terms explain a lot of variance, but this doesn't seem to be the general pattern. In sharp contrast, I usually find that lower-order random terms -- particularly those associated with simple effects of the grouping factors -- explain a pretty good amount of variance and are fairly essential to the model. At the extreme, the residual term commonly accounts for close to the most variance, although of course removing this term wouldn't be sensible.</p>
<p>This entirely informal observation leads me to form the hypothesis that I stated at the beginning of this question.</p>
<p>If it is true, then it constitutes a useful piece of advice that might be passed down to people who are less experience with this kind of model selection process. But before I begin doing so, I want to check with other, more experienced users of mixed models about their reactions to this observation. Does it seem more or less true to you? Is it roughly consistent with your experience fitting many different mixed models to many different datasets? Do you know of any sensible, theoretical reasons why we might actually <em>expect</em> this to be true in a lot of cases? Or does it just seem like bullshit?</p>
<p>One possible answer here is that it is not true even in my own case, and I have simply deceived myself. Certainly a possibility that I am open to.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that it might be true in my own case, but that this could simply be a kind of coincidence having to do with the kinds of datasets that I tend to work with routinely (which, FYI, are datasets in psychological / social sciences, a slight majority being experimental in origin, but also a fair proportion of non-experimental stuff). If this is the case then there is probably no good reason for expecting my observations to hold in general in other fields that handle very different kinds of data. Still, if there is a coherent non-coincidental reason for why this might be expected to be true, even if only for these particular kinds of datasets, I would love to hear it.</p>
<p>And of course another possibility is that others <em>have</em> noticed similar patterns in their own data, and that it represents some kind of general rule of thumb that people find useful to keep in mind as they fit mixed models to various different data. If this is the case then it seems like there must be some compelling statistical-theoretical reason for why this pattern arises. But I really don't know what that reason would look like.</p>
<p>I welcome anyone's thoughts and opinions about this. Note that as far as I'm concerned, totally legitimate responses to this question might be as simple as comments like &quot;Yeah I have noticed something similar in the data I've worked with, but I have no idea why it should be true&quot; or conversely &quot;I have noticed nothing remotely like this in the data I've worked with.&quot; Of course I also welcome longer and more involved discussions ...</p>

57530,8074.0,2,,57525.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>While I'm unsure as to the nature of your problem, I can tell you that I have used PCA as a means of extracting dominant patterns in a group of predictor variables in the later building of a model. In your example, these would be found in the principle components (PCs), <code>PCAAnalysis$x</code>, and they would be based on the weighting of variables found in <code>PCAAnalysis$rotation</code>. One advantage of this process is that PCs are orthogonal, and so you remove issues of multicollinearity between the model predictors. The second, is that you might be able to identify a smaller subset of PCs that capture the majority of variance in your predictors. This information can be found in <code>summary(PCAAnalysis)</code> or in <code>PCAAnalysis$sdev</code>. Finally, if you are interested in using a subset of the PCs for prediction, then you can set the <code>tol</code> parameter in <code>prcomp</code> to a higher level to remove trailing PCs.  </p>

<p>Now, you can ""project"" new data onto the PCA coordinate basis using the <code>predict.prcomp()</code> function. Since you are calling your data set a ""training"" data set, this might make sense to then project a validation data set onto your PCA basis for the calculation of their respective PC coordinates. Below is an example of fitting a PCA to 4 biometric measurements of different iris species (which are correlated to some degree). Following this, I project biometric values of a new data set of flowers that have similar combinations of these measurements for each of the three species of iris. You will see from the final graph that their projected PCs lie in a similar area of the plot as the original data set.</p>

<p>First, <strong>independent variables</strong> are the inputs, causes, or explanatory variables, or predictors to your model, while the <strong>dependent variables</strong> are the outputs from the model, since they ""depend"" on the values of the independent variables (hopefully!).</p>

<p>You can definitely have a single regression line with multiple independent variables. For example, you might model something like
$$ \textrm{Heart Rate} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textrm{Weight} + \beta_2\textrm{Exercise}$$
People sometimes make a distinction between <strong>multiple linear regression</strong>, where the model has two or more explanatory variables, from <strong>simple linear regression</strong>, which has only one. Neither of these should be confused with <strong>multivariate regression</strong>, where one predicts multiple variables at once, as in
$$&lt;\textrm{Heart Rate}, \textrm{Weight}&gt; = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textrm{Exercise} + \ldots$$</p>

<p>Since the independent and dependent variables depend on your hypothesis, only you can decide which are which. For example, you might suspect that resting heart rate is affected by one's weight and exercise habits. If so, you'd use weight and exercise as the independent variables, while heart rate is the dependent variable. This would give you the first model, show above. On the other hand, you might want to predict weight from someone's resting heart rate and exercise. In this case, your model would look something like:
$$ \textrm{Weight} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textrm{Heart Rate} + \beta_2\textrm{Exercise}$$</p>

<p>There are several ways to do a regression in matlab. The <code>regress</code> function (documentation <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/regress.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>) might be a reasonable place to start. You'll need to make an $n \times 1$ vector of responses (call it $y$; it is the dependent variable) and an $n \times p$ vector of predictors (the matching values of the dependent variable(s); call this $x$). Then, you run something like <code>b = regress(y,x);</code> to get the associated coefficients (e.g., b(1) is the coefficient for the values in x(:,1)). Note that if you want a constant term in your model, you need to add a column of all ones to your predictor matrix!</p>

<p>There are several other methods in matlab for fitting linear regression models. The statistics toolbox has a <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/linearmodelclass.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Linear Model</a> class. The curve fitting app <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/cftool.html"" rel=""nofollow"">cftool</a> can interactively fit linear (and other models); the toolbox also includes a programmatic <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/fit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">fit</a> function. Due to how the math works out, you can also just use <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/lscov.html"" rel=""nofollow"">matrix division</a> b = X\y. Take a look and see which of these fits your workflow the best. Beware that <em>some</em> of the methods insert a constant/intercept term into your model but others do not. Make sure you try at least a few out and get what you want. </p>

In [1], Gelman et alia suggest using an (informative) prior to address this problem; the corresponding algorithm is implemented in R as ""bayesglm"" (in the ARM package).</p>

<p>Here is my problem.  Previously, with ""glm"", I would compute p-values as follows:</p>

<pre><code>mylogit &lt;- bayesglm(a ~ b+c+d+e+f+g+h, data = mydata, family=""binomial"")

Residual deviance: 37.862  on 48  degrees of freedom
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I use ""bayesglm"" instead of ""glm"", the resulting degrees of freedom are a bit surprising to me:</p>

57544,20473.0,2,,57429.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>From what I can understand, the real-world phenomenon under study can be described as follows:<br>
 There are at every period $N_t$ customers which are divided given some criterion into ""existing"" and ""new"" (think why the categorization criterion is not necessarily obvious).  </p>

<p>For each of these two subgroups, we define the ""payback rate = percentage of customers of this subgroup who pay back"". For new customers we denote this payback rate $Y_1$ and for existing customers we denote this payback rate $Y_2$. We also have as possible explanatory variables the credit scores for these customers. I presume that $X_1$ symbolizes the <em>average</em> credit score of new customers, and $X_2$ the <em>average</em> credit scores of existing customers.</p>

<p>Now, these payback rates should be examined <em>separately</em>, before attempting to build a model for their weighted average.</p>

<p>We may assume therefore that 
$$Y_{1t}= a_1 + b_1X_{1t} + u_{1t} \qquad [1]$$
and 
$$Y_{2t}= a_2 + b_2X_{2t} + u_{2t} \qquad [2]$$</p>

<p>with $t=1,...,T$ being the length of the time series, and the two error terms assumed white noises, independent of each other, and independent of the regressors.</p>

<p>What we want is to estimate the <em>weighted average pay back rate</em>. Denoting $p_t$ the existing customers as a percentage of the customer base $N_t$, this weighted average payback rate is <em>exactly defined</em> as</p>

<p>$$Y_t = (1-p_t)Y_{1t} + p_tY_{2t} \qquad [3]$$</p>

<p>Relation [3] is a mathematical identity. We turn it into a causal/associative/covariance relationship by inserting into it equations $[1]$ and $[2]$ that refelct theoretical/behavioral assumptions:</p>

<p>$$\{[1],\,[2],\, [3]\} \Rightarrow Y_t = (1-p_t)\left(a_1 + b_1X_{1t} + u_{1t}\right) + p_t\left(a_2 + b_2X_{2t} + u_{2t}\right)$$</p>

<p>$$\Rightarrow Y_t = \left[(1-p_t)a_1 + p_ta_2\right] + (1-p_t)b_1X_{1t} + p_tb_2X_{2t} + (1-p_t)u_{1t} + p_tu_{2t} $$ </p>

<p>$$\Rightarrow Y_t = a_1 + (a_2-a_1)p_t + b_1X_{1t}^* + b_2X_{2t}^* + \varepsilon_t \qquad [4]$$ </p>

<p>with  </p>

<p>$X_{1t}^* = (1-p_t)X_{1t}$ and $X_{2t}^*= p_tX_{2t}$ sub-group credit scores weighted by the relative size of each sub-group,</p>

<p>but most importantly with</p>

<p>$\varepsilon_t = (1-p_t)u_{1t} + p_tu_{2t} $  </p>

<p>This means that the error term is <em>contemporaneously correlated with all three regressors</em>.</p>

<p>Denoting by $\mathbf X$ the regressor matrix containing the time series for $\left(p,X_{1}^*,X_{2}^*\right)$ The <em>conditional</em> moments of $\varepsilon_t$ are</p>

<p>$$E(\varepsilon_t\mid \mathbf X) =E((1-p_t)u_{1t} + p_tu_{2t}\mid \mathbf X)  = (1-p_t)E(u_{1t} \mid \mathbf X)  + p_tE(u_{2t}\mid \mathbf X) = 0$$</p>

<p>since the $u$-errors are independent of $\mathbf X$ and white noises. Also<br>
$$\operatorname {Var}(\varepsilon_t\mid \mathbf X) = E(\varepsilon_t^2\mid \mathbf X) = (1-p_t)^2E\left(u_{1t}^2\mid \mathbf X\right) + p_t^2E\left(u_{2t}^2\mid \mathbf X\right) $$
$$= (1-p_t)^2Eu_{1t}^2 + p_t^2Eu_{2t}^2=(1-p_t)^2\sigma_1^2 + p_t^2\sigma_2^2$$</p>

<p>i.e. the error term is conditionally heteroskedastic, with the conditional variance depending on the regressor $p_t$.</p>

<p>We have arrived at the regression specification $[4]$ by recognizing that the dependent variable is necessarily <em>constructed</em> as a function of the regressors, and so our <em>behavioral/association</em> assumptions should be ""placed"" one step earlier (at sub-group level). From this, the interaction between the regressors emerged naturally. But also, we ended up with endogenous regressors and a heteroskedastic error term, the variance of which changes in each time period and is a function of one of the regressors.
Finally, one should think that, if the model is to be used for prediction, perhaps the $p_t$ should be modeled as an autoregressive scheme, since it is difficult to think that the existing/new customers allocation can exhibit wide variations from one period to the next.  </p>

<p>Concluding, this is your model, or at least, a model that is consistent with the real-world phenomenon under study. As you can see, you have much more serious issues to deal with than just ad hoc ways to represent the interaction between the regressors...</p>

57545,21985.0,1,,,,Sample space of pmf,<self-study>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I have several exercises to solve that deal with sample space of PMF.</p>

<p>One is:</p>

<p>Let $X_1,\dots , X_n$ be independent random variables with pmf $p(x;\pi) = (1-\pi)^x \pi$</p>

<p>What is the sample space of $X_1?$ Try to give a probabalistic interpretation of such a sample space. Hint: for example. a Bernoulli random variable can be used to model a coin with probability of success $p \in \;\rbrack0,1\lbrack$.</p>

<p>Any hint? I do not know how to ""see"" from the distribution what the sample space is without knowing more about this distribution...</p>

<h2>Possible Solution?</h2>

<p>I have the following idea:
If I plug in all values in the sample space and calculate the sum I have to get $1$ (because it is a probability). But obviously here we can have just one value for the sample space which is $\log({\frac{1}{\pi}})/{\log(1-\pi)}$ (I set the formula for pmf to one and solve the equation for x).</p>

<p>The population that I need to extract a sample from is all firms from country A with activities in country B. The firms are classified into two categories: having a subsidiary in country B (S), or not having a subsidiary in country B (NS). I expect the share of S firms to be small relative to NS firms (but I have no way of knowing for sure).</p>

<p>I already hold the entire population of S firms (because this data was available to me). However data on NS firms is not readily available and I have to collect that, and I will probably not get access to identify and collect all NB firms. </p>

<p>So my situation is I have the entire population of S firms, and need to collect enough NS firms for subsequent analysis to be significant. Most likely my final sample will consist of all S firms and some share of the population of NS firms. Without much experience in doing these kinds of studies, I can't help to think that there is some kind is bias/reliability issue when sampling this way (one group: entire group population, other group: some part of group population). I have learned that <em>if</em> it so happens that the population of NS firms is indeed much larger than S firms (again there is no way to know without data for the entire population of firms), and I e.g. end up with similar-sized samples of each group, there will be a case of oversampling the minority group. However I cannot find any remarks anywhere that consider this a problem for a comparison study, as a correct sample representation of the entire population is less important in this manner.</p>

<p>Is my concern justified? Or is it fine to do it that way for e.g. logistic regression? If not, how can I get around the issue?</p>

Still, I am in doubt regarding the concept.</p>
<p>More specifically, it is mentioned by the most voted answer that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In terms of a <strong>simple rule of thumb</strong>, I'd suggest that you:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Run factor analysis if you  assume or wish to test a theoretical model of latent factors causing observed variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run principal components analysis If you want to simply reduce your correlated observed variables to a smaller set of important independent composite variables.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>
<p>I am having difficulties on understanding based on the results I obtained from R where exactly I am inputing my <em>theoretical model of latent factors</em>. I am using the functions from <a href=""http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/factor.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">statsmethods</a>. On both <strong>factanal()</strong> and <strong>princomp()</strong> the inputs were the same: A table where each row represented one data point and the columns consisted of different attributes I was interested on reducing. Thus, this add to my confusion on where is this pre assumed model play its role. I noticed that for factor analysis function I used parallel analysis also suggested by the site using the nScree() function to determine the number of factors and I specified if I wanted a varimax (orthogonal) or promax (oblique) rotation. Is that what is it mean by the model? Being able to choose the amount of factors and the type of rotation?</p>
<p>The results being provided as visual graphs for both PCA and EFA also doesn't seem to highlight this difference which adds to my confusion. Where does this distinction can be observed on them?</p>

PCA</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eg4MN.jpg"" alt=""EFA"" />
EFA</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> -- Answered</p>
<p>I bought a book to study about this from Richard L. Gorsuch. On this book there is something that the author caught attention on the difference between PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and EFA (Exploratory Factor Analysis): It is mentioned that PCA is for <strong>population</strong> while EFA is for <strong>sample</strong>. Is that true? I didn't see that being mentioned on any discussion I read so far. Is it irrelevant?</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong></p>
<p>I noticed that all those methods seems to impose the normal distribution constraint. I also read that for larger sets this constraint can be ignored. Is that true or PCA, EFA and CFA are sensible to distribution constraint violations?</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Where from the results of PCA and EFA should I note that one is talking about latent factors (EFA) and the other is just clustering on components (factors) the variables? The outputs from R looks the same to me. Is it just the way I perceive what the factors being shown as output? I noted that both show me the table where I can see which I can observe which of my variables are expressed the most of my factors. <strong>What is the difference on the interpretation I should have on which variable belongs to which factor</strong> in respect to PCA and EFA? EFA is saying those with higher expression seems to be more explained by that latent factor while PCA is trying to say that factor is holding those variables from what is it observed?</p>
<p><strong>Question 5</strong>
Finally the last question is regarding CFA (Confirmatory Factor Analysis).</p>
<p>On the same function website the following image is being shown:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NNrvh.gif"" alt=""Confirmatory Factor Analysis"" /></p>
<p>I read that CFA is usually followed after EFA for hypothesis testing. In that sense, EFA tells you which are the latent factors (which are the output factors) and then you use CFA assuming those factors you observed from EFA for hypothesis testing?</p>
<p><strong>Question 6</strong></p>
<p>For EFA one of the available rotations on the literature is direct oblimium. I heard that it can accounts for both promax and varimax so 'it takes the best of two words'. Is that true? I am also trying to find a function that employs them on R, since the one suggested on the site does not. I would be happy to get any suggestion on this one.</p>
<hr />
<p>I hope it is noted that this question is way more specific on the doubts regarding EFA and PCA and also adds to CFA so not to get closed for being repeated on the subject. If at least one of the questions is answered I am more than happy too as to clarify the confusion in my head.</p>

57558,19559.0,1,57564.0,,,Puzzling behavior of glmer(),<categorical-data><r><lme4-nlme>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I'd like your opinion on a very strange behavior that I recently encountered running glmer(). The problem is that when I make the dependent variable into a logical vector, glmer behaves weirdly. My dependent variable is Accuracy, and it is coded in terms of 1 (accurate response) and 0 (wrong response). What puzzles me is that transforming accuracy to a logical vector should work the same way for glmer, as a logical vector is coded in terms of TRUE or FALSE, having also 2 levels. However, glmer gives me different results depending on the transformation of the dependent variable I use. Have you guys encountered this before? Do you know why it happens? Below is sample code so you can replicate the problem yourselves.</p>

<p>That is the output of the first model. Now, look at what happens if I transform data$Accuracy into a logical vector when I run the model:</p>

The specific models is of no great concern to my question, but some variables within my autoregressive models are latent binary variables - non-observable binary variables, that is. I have a dataset and use MCMC to find posterior densities of all the parameters of my models, including all the latent binary variables. </p>

<p>I have a dataset of about 1000 observations, and for every observation I have a latent variable in my models, which can wither be 1 or 0. If my data suddendly changes, I can assume that a switch has been turned on and the latent variable has changed. So if the data, at a specific time, is (most likely) best described by the latent variable being 1, my sampler will produce a posterior distribution (for this specific latent variable) with high probability of 1 and low probability of 0.</p>

<p>So this is all good, I have managed to do this. The question is, how do I validate my model? AIC/BIC is just for comparing models. 
What I am thinking is that I have to be able to plot the residuals somehow, like in normal regression where you just say that the residual is the difference of observed and predicted result. 
I understand that for all other parameters than the latent parameters/variables, i can just use the mean of each posterior distribution and treat it like a Maximum Likelihood Estimator. But I cant take the mean of my posterior distributions for all the latent variables, because they are either 0 or 1. It does not make any sense using, for example, 0.8 for one of my latent variables. This is no option.</p>

<p>So how should I go on to validate my model? I am really stuck here. If I have done a bad job explaining my problem, I apologize and will try to explain better.</p>

<hr>

<p>So I have been thinking. Can I use a predictive posterior distribution to validate my model? And if too many observations, lies above, say, the 95 percentile of the predictive posterior distribution, I throw away my model?</p>

<p>Generally, for any model whose parameters are called theta, observations called x, and new observation called x_new, one calculate the predictive posterior distribution as follows:
For i = 1, . . . , n (samples), we sample:
1. theta[i]
from p(theta|x) and
2. x_new[i]
from p(x_new|theta[i])
Then x_new[1], . . . ,x_new[n]
are a sample from the predictive posterior distribution. But this method must surely only work when we have a iid sample. I am working with an autoregressive model. So I am stuck...</p>

<p>We do care, however, about your particular interpretation of probability, which is the important part (though they both agree that the answer to your question is ""No, the probability is $p$"", based on their individual criteria). Briefly consider the two prevailing interpretations:</p>

<ol>
<li>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability"" rel=""nofollow"">Frequentist</a> would say that the given probability $p$ is the fraction of times that the event occurs in a very large number of trials.

Note that we need not to have seen a large number of trials or any trials at all; this is a direct epistemological claim about our sureness in the outcome of the event.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both views agree that we could be wrong; however, $p$ is still the best bet we have. So in a way it is true that under both interpretations $p$ <em>could</em> be incorrect; however, it is not particularly helpful to say so and undermines the usefulness of using $p$ in the first place. </p>

57570,668.0,2,,57545.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p><strong>There are two huge problems with this question that make it unanswerable.</strong></p>

<p><strong>First, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space"" rel=""nofollow"">sample space</a> is a set of outcomes of an experiment.</strong>  A random variable is a function assigning a unique real value to each outcome.  A probability measure on the sample space determines the distribution of the random variable.  <em>Given only the distribution, we cannot possibly identify the sample space.</em>  For instance, the random variable assigning the value $0$ to ""tails"" and $1$ to ""heads"" to describe outcomes of the flip of a fair coin has sample space {""heads"", ""tails""}.  It has a Bernoulli$(1/2)$ distribution.  The random variable assigning the value $0$ to all points in the Earth's northern hemisphere and $1$ to all points in its southern hemisphere has a sample space consisting of all points on Earth.  If all points are considered equally probable, then this variable, too, has a Bernoulli$(1/2)$ distribution--but obviously points on the Earth are not flips of a coin!</p>

<p>Second, let's re-interpret the question to ask about the set of possible values of a random variable (its <em>range</em> as a function), because maybe there is a chance this could be answered with the information given.  Unfortunately, <strong>the question is still ambiguous.</strong> This can be shown by exhibiting two different distributions with different ranges that nevertheless satisfy the given conditions: namely, there exists some number $\pi$ such that the probability of each possible value $x$ is given by the formula $(1-\pi)^x\pi.$  Such a formula suggests (but does not explicitly indicate) that $x$ is intended to be integral, which helps limit our search for counterexamples.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Let the range be $\{-1, 0\}$.  The total probability is</p>

<p>$$1 = (1-\pi)^{-1}\pi + (1-\pi)^0\pi.$$</p>

<p>One solution is $\pi = (3 - \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 0.381966.$</p></li>
<li><p>Let the range be $\{-1, 0, 1\}$.  The total probability is</p>

<p>$$1 = (1-\pi)^{-1}\pi + (1-\pi)^0\pi + (1-\pi)^1\pi.$$</p>

<p>One solution is a root of $x^3 - 3 x^2 + 4 x - 1$ approximately equal to $0.317672.$  (It is the only root lying between $0$ and $1.$)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first distribution assigns probabilities $0.618034$ to $-1$ and $0.381966$ to $0$; the second distribution assigns probabilities $0.465571$ to $-1$, $0.317672$ to $0$, and $0.216757$ to $1$: obviously they are different and have different ranges.</p>

<p>The test data would be taken before an individual has gotten cancer and would predict their probability of getting cancer at any time in the future.</p>

<p>I'm currently experimenting with mixed models, treating this like a repeated measure problem. However, the dependent variable (whether someone ever gets cancer) is not being repeatedly measured over time. Instead it is fixed, so it seemed this might not be the best approach.

<p>$$\left(\frac{\binom{N}{10}-\binom{M}{10}}{\binom{N}{10}}\right)^{K-1}\frac{\binom{M}{10}}{\binom{N}{10}}$$</p>

<p>for the chance of being selected on the $K^\text{th}$ attempt.  Summing these values for $K=1, 2, \ldots$ gives the chance of being selected.  Fortuately, <em>we do not actually have to calculate this chance</em>: it suffices to observe that it does not depend on the particular set we have under consideration, but only on the numbers $N,$ $M,$ and $10.$  Thus, <em>the first sampling procedure selects all desirable sets with equal probability.</em>  Obviously that's what the second procedure does (by design), so the procedures are statistically equivalent, even though they have been conducted differently.</p>

<hr>

<p>This analysis ought to look like overkill, because it is: it should be obvious that all desirable sets have the same chance of being selected using either procedure, because no individual is favored in the selection nor are the selections of any individuals interdependent (as would happen if, for instance, entire households of people were selected at a time).  The reason for presenting this analysis in such detail is to demonstrate, with a simple example, how one might go about evaluating <em>any</em> sampling procedure of a defined population: namely, you determine the chance of every possible sample.  </p>

<p>Although the concept is simple, the results can be very illuminating in complex situations, such as hierarchical sampling or spatial sampling schemes.  For instance, a common way to sample soils in a field is to pick a random origin and a random orientation, lay out a regular grid of points starting at that origin and oriented accordingly, and taking a sample at each grid point that falls within the field.  By emulating the analytical process exemplified here, you will be led to discover that <em>many possible sets of samples have no chance of being selected at all.</em>  For instance, they won't all be in the same half of the field.  This provides valuable insight into why the usual statistical procedures are not valid to apply to such samples (except, occasionally, as approximations).</p>

<p>Anyway, counting degrees of freedom with models that are constrained by a prior can be tricky, and there isn't necessarily a ""correct"" way to do it in many cases.

<p>Although we can't easily calculate the number of degrees of freedom for most regularized models, we can at least put an upper bound on it: the number of degrees of freedom must be less than or equal to the degrees of freedom for the corresponding un-regularized model.</p>

<p>So (assuming the 5 degrees of freedom you reported above is correct), you can plug in 5 and be confident that the true P-value will be no larger than what your Chi-square test predicts.  Thus, if it's significant with 5 degrees of freedom, the true value will also be significant.</p>

<p>If you want something more exact, you might want to look into using the lasso or ridge regression for regularization instead: statisticians have invested a lot of effort into counting degrees of freedom for these models, and have even developed some significance tests for them.

<p>I will answer the following modified version, which I believe accomplishes the goals of the OP's question : <strong>""If we only estimate a logit model with one binary regressor of interest and some (dummy or continuous) control variables, can we tell whether dropping the control variables will result in a change of sign for the (coefficient of) the regressor of interest?""</strong></p>

<p><strong>Notation:</strong> Let $RA\equiv Y$ be the dependent variable, $HHS \equiv X$ the binary regressor of interest and $\mathbf Z$ a matrix of control variables. The size of the sample is $n$. Denote $n_0$ the number of zero-realizations of $X$ and $n_1$ the number of non-zero realizations, $n_0+n_1=n$. Denote $\Lambda()$ the cdf of the logistic distribution.<br>
Let the model including the control variables (the ""unrestricted"" model) be</p>

<p>$$M_U : \begin{align} &amp;P(Y=1\mid X,\mathbf Z)=\Lambda(X, \mathbf Z,b,\mathbf c)\\ &amp;P(Y=0\mid X,\mathbf Z)=1-\Lambda(X, \mathbf Z,b,\mathbf c) \end{align}$$</p>

<p>where $b$ is the coefficient on the regressor of interest.<br>
Let the model including only the regressor of interest (the ""restricted"" model) be</p>

<p>$$M_R : \begin{align} &amp;P(Y=1\mid X)=\Lambda(X, \beta)\\ &amp;P(Y=0\mid X)=1-\Lambda(X,\beta) \end{align}$$</p>

<p><strong>STEP 1</strong>  </p>

<p>Consider the unrestricted model. The first-derivative of the log-likelihood w.r.t to $b$ and the condition for a maximum is</p>

<p>$$\frac {\partial \ln L_U}{\partial b}= \sum_{i=1}^n\left[(y_i-\Lambda_i(x_i, \mathbf z_i,b,\mathbf c)\right]x_i=0 \Rightarrow  b^*: \sum_{i=1}^ny_ix_i=\sum_{i=1}^n\Lambda_i(x_i, \mathbf z_i,b^*,\mathbf c^*)x_i \;[1]$$</p>

<p>The analogous relations for the restricted model is
$$\frac {\partial \ln L_R}{\partial \beta}= \sum_{i=1}^n\left[(y_i-\Lambda_i(x_i,\beta)\right]x_i=0 \Rightarrow  \beta^*: \sum_{i=1}^ny_ix_i=\sum_{i=1}^n\Lambda_i(x_i, \beta^*)x_i \qquad[2]$$</p>

<p>We have </p>

<p>$$\Lambda_i(X,\beta^*) = \frac {1}{1+e^{-x_i\beta^*}}$$</p>

<p>and since $X$ is a zero/one binary variable relation $[2]$ can be written</p>

<p>$$\beta^*: \sum_{i=1}^ny_ix_i=\frac {n_1}{1+e^{-\beta^*}} \qquad[2a]$$</p>

<p>Combining $[1]$ and $[2a]$ and using again the fact that $X$ is binary we obtain the following equality relation between the estimated coefficients of the two models:</p>

<p>$$\frac {n_1}{1+e^{-\beta^*}} = \sum_{i=1}^n\Lambda_i(x_i, \mathbf z_i,b^*,\mathbf c^*)x_i $$</p>

<p>$$\Rightarrow \frac {1}{1+e^{-\beta^*}} = \frac {1}{n_1}\sum_{x_i=1}\Lambda_i(x_i=1, \mathbf z_i,b^*,\mathbf c^*) \qquad [3]$$</p>

<p>$$\Rightarrow \hat P_R(Y=1\mid X=1) =  \hat {\bar P_U}(Y=1\mid X=1,\mathbf Z) \qquad [3a]$$</p>

<p>or in words, that the estimated probability from the restricted model will equal the restricted <em>average</em> estimated probability from the model that includes the control variables.  </p>

<p><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>
For a sole binary regressor in a logistic regression, its marginal effect $m_R(X)$ is</p>

<p>$$ \hat m_R(X)= \hat P_R(Y=1\mid X=1) - \hat P_R(Y=1\mid X=0)$$</p>

<p>$$ \Rightarrow \hat m_R(X) = \frac {1}{1+e^{-\beta^*}} - \frac 12$$</p>

<p>and using $[3]$</p>

<p>$$  \hat m_R(X) = \frac {1}{n_1}\sum_{x_i=1}\Lambda_i(x_i=1, \mathbf z_i,b^*,\mathbf c^*) - \frac 12 \qquad [4]$$</p>

<p>For the unrestricted model that includes the control variables we have</p>

<p>$$ \hat m_U(X)= \hat P_U(Y=1\mid X=1, \bar {\mathbf z}) - \hat P_U(Y=1\mid X=0, \bar {\mathbf z})$$</p>

<p>$$\Rightarrow \hat m_U(X) = \frac {1}{1+e^{-b^*-\bar {\mathbf z}'\mathbf c^*}} - \frac {1}{1+e^{-\bar {\mathbf z}'\mathbf c^*}} \qquad [5]$$</p>

<p>where $\bar {\mathbf z}$ contains the <em>sample means</em> of the control variables.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that the marginal effect of $X$ has the same sign as its estimated coefficient. Since we have expressed the marginal effect of $X$ from both models in terms of the estimated coefficients from the unrestricted model, we can estimated only the latter, and then calculate the above two expressions ($[4]$ and $[5]$) which will tell us whether we will observe a sign reversal for the coefficient of $X$ or not, without the need to estimate the restricted model.  </p>

<p>It seems that doing seasonal adjustment for the time-series separately leads at least to the inefficient estimates.</p>

57591,21243.0,2,,53439.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>As the user above points out, this is not simply an issue of choosing a machine learning method and letting it go wild on the data. Particularly, the introduction of decision theory (even in a basic form) is vital. While the inclusion of something like ""decision theory"" might seem a bit complex, this really only means in your case that you are not simply estimating a quantity and figuring out if you are right; that is, not every wrong solution is ""equally wrong"", in the sense that you'll need to take into account your profit and your funds left in reserve.</p>

<p>A general approach is difficult to recommend without intimate knowledge of the data. However, it sounds like you'll need to formalize the aspects of your model. Think about the following questions as you decide on your model:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the quantity I am trying to predict? (In this case, it sounds like you are looking for the particular markup at which you should sell, and/or the price at which to buy so that a profit can be made, which is just as much optimization as it is machine learning).</li>
<li>What examples can I use to train my model, and what are my inputs? What market factors can I train my model with to predict the quantities in (1)?</li>
</ol>

<p>As a final point, it is really quite unlikely that reinforcement learning is the approach you'll want to take in this case. Reinforcement learning is quite powerful in certain situations, but is somewhat unpredictable (depending on the particular formulation), and tends to make an awful lot of errors before it gets anything right (something that likely is not an option when there is money on the line). As I said, try to figure out which quantities you want to estimate, then figure out what market factors might affect those quantities.</p>

If this probability were greater than 0.5, I'd chose model A and otherwise model B (c.f. Mann-Whitney U test?)  However, I strongly suspect that will end up choosing the model with the lower mean unless the distributions of the performance statistic are very non-symmetric.</p>

<p>For grid search on the other hand, the situation is a bit different as you are not really comparing different methods, but instead tuning the (hyper-) parameters of the same model to fit a finite sample of data (in this case indirectly via cross-validation).  I have found that this kind of tuning can be very prone to over-fitting, see my paper</p>

<p>I have a paper in review that shows that it is probably best to use a relatively coarse grid for kernel machines (e.g. SVMs) to avoid over-fitting the model selection criterion.  Another approach (which I haven't investigated, so caveat lector!) would be to choose the model with the highest error that is not statistically inferior to the best model found in the grid search (although that may be a rather pessimistic approach, especially for small datasets).</p>

<p>The real solution though is probably not to optimise the parameters using grid-search, but to average over the parameter values, either in a Bayesian approach, or just as an ensemble method.  If you don't optimise, it is more difficult to over-fit!</p>

You should be able to pick up an older version (sixth edition or before) online for relatively cheap.  Seventh is not noticeably better than sixth.  I am changing your notation $Cov(\hat{\beta})$ to 
$V(\hat{\beta}_{\textrm{OLS}})$, but I mean the same thing by it.</p>

<p>Here is the proof:</p>

<p>If </p>

<ol>
<li>$Y=Z\beta+\epsilon$</li>
<li>$E\left\{\epsilon|Z \right\}=0$</li>
<li>$V\left(\epsilon|Z \right)=\sigma^2I$</li>
<li>The OLS estimator exists and is unique (i.e. $Z'Z$ invertible)</li>
</ol>

<p>then the OLS estimator is unbiased for $\beta$ and 
$V\left(\hat{\beta}_{\textrm{OLS}}|Z \right)=\sigma^2(Z'Z)^{-1}$.</p>

<p>Proof:
Using the definition of the OLS estimator and then substituting in using 1:
\begin{align}
\hat{\beta}_{\textrm{OLS}} &amp;= \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}Z'Y\\
                           &amp;= \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}Z'\left( Z\beta+\epsilon \right)\\
                           &amp;= \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}Z'Z\beta 
                              + \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}Z'\epsilon\\
                           &amp;= \beta + \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}Z'\epsilon
\end{align}
Taking expectations of both sides conditional on $Z$ gives you that the OLS estimator is unbiased.  Taking variances on both sides conditional on $Z$ gives you:
\begin{align}
V\left( \hat{\beta}_{\textrm{OLS}} | Z \right)
   &amp;= V\left( \beta + \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}Z'\epsilon | Z \right)\\
   &amp;= V\left(\left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}Z'\epsilon | Z \right) \\
   &amp;= \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}Z'V\left(\epsilon | Z \right) Z \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1} \\
   &amp;= \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}Z'\sigma^2I Z \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1} \\
   &amp;= \sigma^2\left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}Z'Z \left( Z'Z\right)^{-1} \\
   &amp;= \sigma^2\left( Z'Z\right)^{-1}
\end{align}
QED</p>

<p>This does not quite give you what you asked for, since the variance is conditional on $Z$ rather than unconditional.  If you want the variance to be unconditional, you have to additionally assume that $Z$ is fixed, so that the conditional variance becomes just an unconditional variance.  On the other hand, this is the right variance conditional on the dataset you used to estimate $\beta$ with OLS, and inference based on this variance gives (asymptotically, if you don't assume $\epsilon$ normal) you correctly-sized hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.</p>

&amp;min_{\lambda}V(\lambda\hat{\beta}_1+(1-\lambda)\hat{\beta}_2)\\
&amp;min_{\lambda}\lambda^2V(\hat{\beta}_1)+(1-\lambda)^2V(\hat{\beta}_2)
+2\lambda(1-\lambda)Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)
\end{align}
The first order condition is:
\begin{align}
2\lambda V(\hat{\beta}_1)-2(1-\lambda)V(\hat{\beta}_2)
+2(1-2\lambda)Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)&amp;=0 \\
\frac{V(\hat{\beta}_2)-Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)}{V(\hat{\beta}_1)+V(\hat{\beta}_2)-2Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)} &amp;= \lambda
\end{align}
The combined estimator is then:
\begin{align}
\hat{\beta}_* = \frac{V(\hat{\beta}_2)-Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)}{V(\hat{\beta}_1)+V(\hat{\beta}_2)-2Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)} \hat{\beta}_1 +
\frac{V(\hat{\beta}_1)-Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)}{V(\hat{\beta}_1)+V(\hat{\beta}_2)-2Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)} \hat{\beta}_2
\end{align}
Because of the way we set up $\lambda$ in the minimization, you are assured that this new estimator is consistent.  Notice, if the covariance between the two estimators is zero, then this new estimator is just the weighted sum of the two original estimators where the original estimators are weighted inversely to their variance---the new estimator ""pays attention"" to the old estimators inversely according to their variances.</p>

<p>Finally, the variance of the new estimator is:
\begin{align}
V(\hat{\beta}_*) = \frac{V(\hat{\beta}_1)V(\hat{\beta}_2)-2Cov^2(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)}{V(\hat{\beta}_1)+V(\hat{\beta}_2)-2Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)}
\end{align}</p>

57628,18198.0,1,,,,Estimators for linear regression when multicollinearity is present,<pca><lasso><ridge-regression><elastic-net><isotonic>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I have a multicollinearity problem in a linear regression model and ridge regression was suggested as a solution. So I have spent quite some time researching different ridge regressors in the literature (there's at least a dozen), however in the course of my research I have found that Principal Components Regression can be considered a special case of ridge regression and so I am including it too. Clearly Partial Least Squares regression is closely linked to Principal Component Regression so it seems it should be added too (although I haven't researched that yet). Also when deriving Ridge regression from the Bayesian viewpoint it became obvious that a Kalman filter approach could be used to implement the Bayesian approach so I'm including that too. The Bayes approach seems fairly natural in my application as I have several years worth of data some in which the collinearity effects are present some where they are not so I can build up a decent prior for the Beta parameters for the cases where little or no MC is present.</p>

<p>I have reviewed various comparison papers and they usually compare the estimators on the basis of their Mean Square Error Performance. Generally in the Ridge v Bayes/Kalman there seems to be no clear winner with the performance depending on the orientation of the betas being estimated to the principal components of the design matrix, the level of multicollinearity and the signal to noise ratio. So it would seem that the best estimator can only be defined in the sense of the best for a given problem.    </p>

<p><a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/866/when-should-i-use-lasso-vs-ridge"">When should I use lasso vs ridge?</a></p>

<p>Now through my research I have stumbled into Lasso (and Least Angle regression) and from the answers to the previous thread (see above) I can add ""Elastic Net"" and ""non-negative garrote"" (and probably more). I just wonder whether it makes sense to add these to my comparison too? If I'm totally honest it seems that I should. The theory behind the Lasso is pretty similar to that used for the Ridge estimator with the optimization being done in the L1 rather than L2 space.    </p>

<p>Ideally I would like to compare all the different classes of shrinkage estimators using the best estimator from each class. Right now I have at least a dozen ridge regressors and no way a priori of knowing which would be best for my problem (given the inconclusive results of the comparison papers I mentioned previously). If I only have to add say the ""Lasso"" and ""Elastic-net"" and even the ""Non-negative Garrotte"" then probably I can do it but if they have as many variations as the Ridge literature has and similar problems identifying which one is likely to be best for a given problem then it seems that the whole thing may become rather unwieldy and I can't cover every approach that's ever been suggested in the literature. So my questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li>What are the different classes of estimators to deal with Multicollinearity in linear regression: eg. Ridge, PCR, PLS, Lasso...</li>
<li>Apart from Ridge regression do these other classes have one implementation that is generally regarded as best. Any paper I have seen that compares Ridge to other classes of estimators, the authors generally use the basic Ridge regression method which is shown to be one of the poorest performing ridge methods.</li>
<li>Do you have experience in comparing Ridge to these other techniques and which was found to be best?</li>
<li>Is it realistic to compare these different classes all together?</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a list of the lasso techniques I have found from a review article by Tibshirani (2011):</p>

<p>Grouped Lasso;
Elastic Net Lasso;
Fusd Lasso;
Adaptive Lasso;
Graphical Lasso; 
Dantzig selector;
Near Isotonic Regulation;
Matrix Completion;
Compressive Sensing;
Multivariate Methods;</p>

<p>Now my problem consists of only 4 different X values and around 30 y values. The really high multicollinearity occurs between X variables 3 &amp; 4. Although there can be significant multicollinearity with variable 2 as well. (Variable 1 is a constant).  </p>

<p>Most of these techniques are suited for p>>N but this seems directly at odds with the comment from Gary here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/866/when-should-i-use-lasso-vs-ridge"">When should I use lasso vs ridge?</a></p>

<p>That lasso should be used when you have high multicollinearity effects and few variables?</p>

<p>In any case given my problem I think that the Lasso and Elastic Net are most suitable.
Can anyone shed any light as to whether any of the remaining techniques may be helpful for my problem? </p>

<p>Since the papers are published online as PDF files, I assume that you have a PDF file which contains vector plot with data you wish to recover from it (get in numerical form) and estimate introduced recovery error.</p>

<p>First of all, PDF is a vector format which is basically textual (can be read by a text editor). The problem is that it can (and almost always) contain compressed data streams which require to be uncompressed in order to read them by a text editor. These compressed data streams usually contain the information we need.</p>

<p>There are several ways to uncompress data streams in order to convert PDF file to a textual document with readable PDF code. Probably the simplest way is to use free <a href=""http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QPDF utility</a> with <a href=""http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/files/qpdf-manual.html#ref.advanced-transformation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>--stream-data=uncompress</code> option</a>:</p>

<pre><code>qpdf infile.pdf --stream-data=uncompress -- outfile.pdf
</code></pre>

<p>Some other ways are described <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/18813227/590388"">here</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/3438394/590388"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The generated outfile.pdf can be opened by a text editor. Now you need <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDF Reference Manual 1.7</a> to understand what you see. Do not panic at this moment! You need to know only few operators described in the ""TABLE 4.9 Path construction operators"" on pages 226 - 227. The most important operators are (the first column contains coordinate specification for an operator, the second contains the operator and the third is operator name):</p>

<pre><code>x y               m   moveto 

x y               l   lineto 

x y width height  re  rectangle

                  h   closepath
</code></pre>

<p>In most cases it is sufficient to know these four operators for recovering the data. </p>

<p>Now you need to import the outfile.pdf file as text into some program where you can manipulate the data. I'll show how to do it with <a href=""http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Mathematica</em></a>.</p>

<p>Importing the file:</p>

<pre><code>pdfCode = Import[""outfile.pdf"", ""Text""];
</code></pre>

<p>Now I assume the simplest case: the graph contains a line which consists of many two-point segments. In this case each segment of the line is encoded like this:</p>

<pre><code>268.79999 408.92975 m
272.39999 408.92975 l
</code></pre>

<p>Extracting all such segments from the PDF code:</p>

<pre><code>lines = StringCases[pdfCode, 
   StartOfLine ~~ x1 : NumberString ~~ "" "" ~~ y1 : NumberString ~~ "" m\n"" ~~ 
                  x2 : NumberString ~~ "" "" ~~ y2 : NumberString ~~ "" l\n"" 
                                        :&gt; ToExpression@{{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}}]; 
</code></pre>

<p>Visualizing them:</p>

<pre><code>Graphics[{Line[lines]}]
</code></pre>

<p>You get something like this (the paper I am working with contains four graphs):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qu32M.png"" alt=""plot""></p>

<p>Each two adjacent segments share one point. So in this case you can turn the sequences of adjacent segments into paths:</p>

<pre><code>paths = Split[lines, #1[[2]] == #2[[1]] &amp;];
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can visualize all the paths separately:</p>

<pre><code>Graphics[{Line /@ paths}]
</code></pre>

<p>From this figure you can select (by double-clicking) the path you are looking for, copy graphics selection and paste as new <code>Graphics</code>. For converting it backward to list of points you take the element <code>{1, 1, 1}</code>. Now we have the points not in the coordinate system of the graph but in the coordinate system of the PDF file. We need to establish relationship between them. </p>

<p>From the above plot you select ticks by hand (holding <code>Shift</code> for multiple selection), then copy them and paste as new <code>Graphics</code>. Here is how you can extract coordinates of horizontal ticks:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wmXNB.png"" alt=""screenshot""></p>

<p>Now check the differences between ticks:</p>

<pre><code>Differences[reHorTicks]
</code></pre>

<p>From these differences you can see how precise is positioning of the ticks in the PDF file. It gives an estimate of error introduced by converting original datapoints into vector graph included in the PDF file. If there are appreciable errors in ticks positioning you can reduce the error by fitting the coordinates of ticks to a linear model. This linear function now can be used to get original coordinates of points of the path (that is in the coordinate system of the plot).</p>

<p>I have a colleague interested in a particular disease and specifically if the continuous variable $X$ is different between controls and patients. Preliminary results suggest that patients have higher values of $X$ than controls.</p>

<p>The straightforward approach would be a unpaired <strong>t-test</strong> to test if there is a difference in mean values between patients and controls.</p>

<p>However, the literature suggests that <strong>age</strong> and <strong>sex</strong> are correlated with $X$ so my colleague wanted to control for this when testing. Hence, she decided to use regression to solve the problem.</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>My colleague's supervisor reasons that since they do not know if it is the disease that causes raised $X$ or if raised $X$ causes the disease they could use either linear regression or logistic regression to solve the problem. The supervisor also argued that logistic regression was the preferable approach.</p>

<p>If $d$ is a categorical variable with levels {control, disease} then the first model could be written</p>

<p>$$X = \beta_0 + \beta_1 d + \beta_2 \text{age} + \beta_2\text{sex} + \epsilon$$</p>

I do not know if there were any significant differences between the sex and age distributions between patients and controls.</p>

<p>There were also indications that the variance in $X$ was different in the two groups and questions were asked if this would influence the regression models.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that because my colleague is interested in the conditional expected value $E(X|d,\text{age},\text{sex})$ she should use the ordinary regression model or just a t-test (if there are no age or sex differences between groups).</p>

<p>It's not that there is no valid method of detecting collinearity in logistic regression: Since collinearity is a relationship among the independent variables, the dependent variable doesn't matter. </p>

<p>What is problematic is figuring out how much collinearity is too much for logistic regression. David Belslely did extensive work with condition indexes. He found that indexes over 30 with substantial variance accounted for in more than one variable was indicative of collinearity that would cause severe problems in OLS regression. However, ""severe"" is always a judgment call. Perhaps the easiest way to see the problems of collinearity is to show that small changes in the data make big changes in the results. </p>

<p>[this paper http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/joseph/courses/epib-621/logconfound.pdf] offers examples of collinearity in logistic regression. It even shows that <code>R</code> detects exact collinearity, and, in fact, some cases of approximate collinearity will cause the same warning:</p>

<pre><code>Warning message:
glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred
</code></pre>

<p>Nevertheless, we can ignore this warning and run</p>

<pre><code>set.seed(1234)
x1 &lt;- rnorm(100)
x2 &lt;- rnorm(100)
x3 &lt;- x1 + x2 + rnorm(100, 0, 1)

y &lt;- x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3 + rnorm(100)
ylog &lt;- cut(y, 2, c(1,0))

m1&lt;- glm(ylog~x1+x2+x3, family = binomial)
coef(m1)
</code></pre>

<p>which yields -2.55, 1.97, 5.60 and 12.54</p>

<p>We can then slightly perturb x1 and x2, add them for a new x3 and run again:</p>

<pre><code>x1a &lt;- x1+rnorm(100,0,.01)
x2a &lt;- x2+rnorm(100,0, .01)
x3a &lt;- x1a + x2a + rnorm(100, 0, 1)

ya &lt;- x1a + 2*x2a + 3*x3a + rnorm(100)
yloga &lt;- cut(ya, 2, c(1,0))


m2&lt;- glm(ylog~x1a+x2a+x3a, family = binomial)
coef(m2)
</code></pre>

<p>this yields wildly different coefficients: 0.003, 3.012, 3.51 and -0.41</p>

<p>and yet, this set of independent variables does not have a high condition index:</p>

<pre><code>library(perturb)
colldiag(m1)

57655,5237.0,2,,57650.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I say you are right.  You should use OLS regression here, not logistic regression.  </p>

<p>The question of causality is a red herring.  Causality is not required for either linear regression or logistic regression, and it is fine to model a cause as a (e.g., linear) function of an effect.  In fact, there are predictive models that do so.  As an example, researchers studying the collapse of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization#The_Maya_collapse"" rel=""nofollow"">Mayan civilization</a> have hypothesized that drought may have initiated its decline.  Predictive models have been built that allow researchers to make an educated guess about rainfall levels (i.e., causes) from traces that remain (i.e., effects; e.g., analyses of core samples from lake beds), to clarify this possibility.  </p>

<p>Which variable should be made the <em>response</em> variable, and which the <em>explanatory</em> variable should be decided based on the question you want to answer.  It is clear from your setup that you are wondering about possible differences in the level of $X$ given the disease state.  Thus, $X$ should be the response variable, and disease state should be the explanatory variable.  </p>

The continuous predictor allows you to make a more nuanced probabilistic statement about the disease relationship rather than the more blunt categorization statement of the relationship resulting from using disease as the predictor.</p>

<p>You did word your initial question about whether X was different between controls and patients but it isn't clear that future use of the information might better be served by being able to make statements about the probability of disease given the value of X. I'm trusting that your supervisor has better knowledge of the more general use of the findings and therefore would offer more appropriate advice than any of us can here.</p>

<p>It gets a bit tricky looking at your covariates of age and sex when they're primarily supposed to be related to X. My guess is they're related to both X and disease, in which case you really need to treat them not as covariates, that are generally ignored, but as fully analyzed predictors. You'll need to know the correlations among your predictors and how they influence your model.</p>

57663,21586.0,2,,57500.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I fear that there exist some notational differences across different sub-disciplines of statistics. Let me stick to a pragmatic, non-technical notation quite commonly used in Econometrics. Further, in my answer let me add point 5. to the list above, denoting semi-parametric regression models.</p>

<p>As an illustrative example consider the case of an <strong>additive regression model</strong> with response $Y$, regression function $g(X)$ and error process $U$,
\begin{equation} 
Y=g(X)+U 
\end{equation}
Usually we distinguish between 
1. linear and
2. non-linear 
<strong>regression functions</strong>, where ""linearity"" refers to linearity-in-parameters. Common examples used in Econometrics are</p>

<ol>
<li><p>$g(X)=\beta_0+\beta_1 X$</p></li>
<li><p>$g(X)=\beta_0X^{\beta_1}$</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now both cases 1. and 2., respectively, can be present in 3. parametric and 5. semi-parametric <strong>regression models</strong>. A prominent example of 3. is $U \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, while case 5. is present if we do not wish to impose a parametric assumption about the distribution of $U$.</p>

<p>Finally, the regression function $g(X)$ may not contain parameters. If in addition we do not wish to impose a parametric assumption about the distribution of $U$ we have a 4. non-parametric regression model.</p>

<p><em>Remarks</em>. As noted above there are different perceptions on how to define a non- or a semi-parametric model. Further, in case of non-additive regressions notational distinction becomes even more complicated.

<p>Low-rank approximation is thus a way to recover the ""original"" (the ""ideal"" matrix before it was messed up by noise etc.) low-rank matrix i.e., find the matrix that is most consistent (in terms of observed entries) with the current matrix and is low-rank so that it can be used as an approximation to the ideal matrix.

57687,594.0,2,,57359.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>When including polynomials and interactions between them, multicollinearity can be a big problem; one approach is to look at orthogonal polynomials.</p>

<p>Generally, orthogonal polynomials are a family of polynomials which are orthogonal with 
respect to some inner product.</p>

<p>So for example in the case of polynomials over some region with weight function $w$, the 
inner product is $\int_a^bw(x)p_m(x)p_n(x)dx$ - orthogonality makes that inner product $0$ 
unless $m=n$.</p>

<p>The simplest example for continuous polynomials is the Legendre polynomials, which have 
constant weight function over a finite real interval (commonly over $[-1,1]$).</p>

<p>In our case, the space (the observations themselves) is discrete, and our weight function is also constant (usually), so the orthogonal polynomials are a kind of discrete equivalent of Legendre polynomials. With the constant included in our predictors, the inner product is simply $p_m(x)^Tp_n(x) = \sum_i p_m(x_i)p_n(x_i)$.</p>

<p>For example, consider $x = 1,2,3,4,5$</p>

<p>Start with the constant column, $p_0(x) = x^0 = 1$. The next polynomial is of the form $ax-b$, but we're not worrying about scale at the moment, so $p_1(x) = x-\bar x = x-3$. The next polynomial would be of the form $ax^2+bx+c$; it turns out that $p_2(x)=(x-3)^2-2 = x^2-6x+7$ is orthogonal to the previous two:</p>

<pre><code>x         p0  p1  p2   
1          1  -2   2   
2          1  -1  -1
3          1   0  -2
4          1   1  -1
5          1   2   2
</code></pre>

<p>Frequently the basis is also normalized (producing an orthonormal family) - that is, the sums of squares of each term is set to be some constant (say, to $n$, or to $n-1$, so that the standard deviation is 1, or perhaps most frequently, to $1$).</p>

<p>Ways to orthogonalize a set of polynomial predictors include Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, and Cholesky decomposition, though there are numerous other approaches.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some of the advantages of orthogonal polynomials:</p>

<p>1) multicollinearity is a nonissue - these predictors are all orthogonal.</p>

<p>2) The low-order coefficients <em>don't change as you add terms</em>. If you fit a degree $k$ polynomial via orthogonal polynomials, you know the coefficients of a fit of all the lower order polynomials without re-fitting.</p>

Some of the output had only significant main effect while others had no sig. effects. But the graph that the SPSS produced with the estimated marginal means clearly indicates a significant interaction. </p>

Lineup ethnicity x Participant sex at two levels of Lineup Sex.</p>

57745,2081.0,2,,57710.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p><strong>Nominal vs Interval</strong></p>

<p>The most classic ""correlation"" measure between a nominal and an <strong><em>interval</em></strong> (""numeric"") variable is <strong>Eta</strong>, also called correlation ratio, and equal to the root R-square of the one-way ANOVA (with p-value = that of the ANOVA). Eta can be seen as a symmetric association measure, like correlation, because Eta of ANOVA (with the nominal as independent, numeric as dependent) is equal to Pillai's trace of multivariate regression (with the numeric as independent, set of dummy variables corresponding to the nominal as dependent).</p>

<p>A more subtle measure is intraclass correlation coefficient (<strong>ICC</strong>). Whereas Eta grasps only the difference between groups (defined by the nominal variable) in respect to the numeric variable, ICC simultaneously also measures the coordination or agreemant between numeric values inside groups; in other words, ICC (particularly the original unbiased ""pairing"" ICC version) stays on the level of values while Eta operates on the level of statistics (group means vs group variances).</p>

<p><strong>Nominal vs Ordinal</strong></p>

<p>The question about ""correlation"" measure between a nominal and an <strong><em>ordinal</em></strong> variable is less apparent. The reason of the difficulty is that ordinal scale is, by its nature, more ""mystic"" or ""twisted"" than interval or nominal scales. No wonder that statistical analyses specially for ordinal data are relatively poorly formulated so far.</p>

<p>One way might be to convert your ordinal data <em>into ranks</em> and then compute <strong>Eta</strong> as if the ranks were interval data. The p-value of such Eta = that of Kruskal-Wallis analysis. This approach seems warranted due to the same reasoning as why Spearman rho is used to correlate two ordinal variables. That logic is ""when you don't know the interval widths on the scale, cut the Gordian knot by linearizing any possible monotonicity: go rank the data"".</p>

<p>Another approach (possibly more rigorous and flexible) would be to use <em>ordinal logistic regression</em> with the ordinal variable as the DV and the nominal one as the IV. The square root of <strong>Nagelkerke’s</strong> pseudo R-square (with the regression's p-value) is another correlation measure for you. Note that you can experiment with various link functions in ordinal regression. This association is, however, not symmetric: the nominal is assumed independent.</p>

<p>Yet another approach might be to <em>find</em> such a monotonic transformation of ordinal data into interval - instead of ranking of the penultimate paragraph - that would <em>maximize</em> R (i.e. <strong>Eta</strong>) for you. This is <em>categorical regression</em> (= linear regression with optimal scaling).</p>

<p>Still another approach is to perform <em>classification tree</em>, such as CHAID, with the ordinal variable as predictor. This procedure will <em>bin together</em> (hence it is the approach opposite to the previous one) adjacent ordered categories which do not distinguish among categories of the nominal predictand. Then you could rely on Chi-square-based association measures (such as Cramer's V) as if you correlate nominal vs nominal variables.</p>

<p>And @Michael in his comment suggests yet one more way - a special coefficient called Freeman's <strong>Theta</strong>.</p>

<p>So, we have arrived so far at these opportunities: (1) Rank, then compute Eta; (2) Use ordinal regression; (3) Use categorical regression (""optimally"" transforming ordinal variable into interval); (4) Use classification tree (""optimally"" reducing the number of ordered categories); (5) Use Freeman's Theta.</p>

57701,8386.0,2,,57698.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>If there is no replacement of balls after drawing, then approaches 1 and 2 are equivalent. With approach 2, you can find the average of the proportions of white balls in each of the 10 samples, or find the total number of white balls in the 10 samples combined and express this as a proportion of 500.  Both calculations will give the same result (given that, as is the case here, the samples are all of the same size).</p>

<p>If however for approach 2 the balls are replaced after each sample of 50, then the sampling error will be slightly higher than with approach 1.  One way to see this is to consider the extreme case in which rather than 100000 there are only 500 balls in the jar. In that case approach 1, which would then be a 100% sample, would be guaranteed to estimate the true proportion correctly.  But approach 2 would still be subject to sampling error because each sample of 50 would be only a 10% sample.  With a much larger number of balls this effect is still present, albeit greatly diminished.</p>

57708,2666.0,2,,57359.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I don't feel that centering is worth the trouble, and centering makes the interpretation of parameter estimates more complex.  If you use modern matrix algebra software, algebraic collinearity is not a problem.  Your original motivation of centering to be able to interpret main effects in the presence of interaction is not a strong one.  Main effects when estimated at any automatically chosen value of a continuous interacting factor are somewhat arbitrary, and it's best to think of this as a simple estimation problem by comparing predicted values.  In the R <code>rms</code> package <code>contrast.rms</code> function, for example, you can obtain any contrast of interest independent of variable codings.  Here is an example of a categorical variable x1 with levels ""a"" ""b"" ""c"" and a continuous variable x2, fitted using a restricted cubic spline with 4 default knots.  Different relationships between x2 and y are allowed for different x1.  Two of the levels of x1 are compared at x2=10.</p>

<pre><code>require(rms)
dd &lt;- datadist(x1, x2); options(datadist='dd')
f &lt;- ols(y ~ x1 * rcs(x2,4))
contrast(f, list(x1='b', x2=10), list(x1='c', x2=10))
# Now get all comparisons with c:
contrast(f, list(x1=c('a','b'), x2=10), list(x1='c', x2=10))
# add type ='joint' to get a 2 d.f. test, or conf.type='simultaneous'
# to get simultaneous individual confidence intervals

<p>With this approach you can also easily estimate contrasts at several values of the interacting factor(s), e.g.</p>

57709,22716.0,2,,57696.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Generally, you should start from the highest order interactions. You are probably aware that it is usually not sensible to interpret a main effect A when that effect is also involved in an interaction A:B. This is because the interaction tells you that the effect of A actually depends on the level of B, rendering any simple main effect interpretation of A impossible.
In the same way, if you have factors A, B, C, then A:B should not be interpreted if A:B:C is significant.</p>

<p>Thus, when you have a 5-way interaction, none of the lower-order interactions can be sensibly interpreted. Therefore, if I understand you correctly and you have interpreted your lower order interactions, you should probably not continue along those lines.</p>

<p>Rather, what you can do is to split up your data set and continue to analyze factor levels of your data set separately. Which of the factors you use to split up the dataset is arbitrary, but often it is very useful to split up the data for each variable and assess what you see. In your example, you might start with sex, and calculate an ANOVA for males, and another one for females (each ANOVA contains the 4 remaining factors). Just as well, you could split up the data according to ethnicity (one ANOVA for Asian, one for Caucasian).
You could also split up by one of the within-subject factors.</p>

<p>I will assume that you have decided to split the data by sex (just to continue with the example here).
Then, assume that for males, you get a 4-way interaction. You would then go on to split up the male data by one of the remaining variables (say, ethnicity). You would then calculate ANOVAs for male Asians (over the remaining 3 factors), and for male Caucasians.</p>

<p>Importantly, if you get only a lower-order interaction, then you are only ""allowed"" to analyze these further. This is because the other factors did not show significant differences. Thus, if your males ANOVA gives you only a 2-way interaction, then you would average over the other factors and calculate only an ANOVA over the 2 interacting factors (and, because we are in the male part of the ANOVAs, this would be for the males alone).</p>

<p>For the females, everything may look different, and so the decision which follow-up ANOVAs to calculate is separate for this group. So, what you did for males should be done for females in the same way ONLY if you got the same interactions.</p>

<p>Thus, you will potentially have a lot of ANOVAs, and it might not be easy to decide which ones to report. You should report 1 complete line down from the hightest interaction to the last effects (possibly t-tests to compare only 1 of your factors at the end). You should not usually report several lines (e.g., one starting the split-up by sex, then another one starting by ethnicity). However, you must report a complete line, and cannot simply choose to report only some of the ANOVAs of that line. So, you report one complete analysis, not more, not less. Which way to go in terms of splitting up / follow-up ANOVA is a subjective decision (unless you have clear hypotheses you can follow), and might depend on which results can be understood best etc.</p>

The CLT applies to the <strong>arithmetic mean</strong> of a distribution—<strong><em>not</em></strong> the distribution itself. Given an increasing number of samples, the average of those samples tends to be normally distributed with the ""mean mean"" equal to the overall mean and the variance of that mean estimator proportional to the variance and the number of samples. The actual distribution itself is not going to be normal. If anything, the distribution of the samples (NOT their average) will flesh out the shape of the distribution and you will have a greater chance of seeing an extreme value the more samples are generated.</p>

<p>My hunch is that your routing score is probably an average of some values, and, as such, is the mean of some distribution. If so, as the mean of a distribution, under many conditions <em>its own</em> distribution will tend to the normal after enough samples are generated.</p>

The real question is what conclusions you would be able to draw from your Sobel test.</p>

<p>To get a clear sense of the problem, consider a simple study in which the researcher measures people's scores on a self-report measure of trait empathy and the amount of money these people donated to charitable causes within the last year.  Assuming that the researchers observed a relationship between trait empathy and donations, few people would make the mistake of concluding that trait empathy causes donations (i.e., empathy -> donations), since the people in the study were not randomized to their values of trait empathy.  Thus, it is possible that people who thought about their levels of donations reported higher levels of trait empathy (i.e., donations -> empathy) or that a third variable caused the observed values of both donations and empathy.</p>

<p>Let's now consider a study in which the researchers measured trait empathy, charitable donations, and positive emotions.  The researcher wishes to show that the experience of positive emotions mediates the link between trait empathy and charitable donations (i.e., that empathy -> positive emotions -> donations).  In order to convincingly establish mediation, we must show both that empathy -> positive emotions and that empathy -> donations.  However, because people were not randomized to their values of trait empathy, we cannot conclude that empathy caused either positive emotions or donations.</p>

<p>However, even if we had randomized people to their empathy scores, we would still not necessarily be able to conclude that positive emotions were a mediator for the empathy -> donations effect because, after people's assignment to their empathy scores, people were not randomized to their values of positive emotions.  Thus, even if we established a non-zero indirect effect, it is possible that, for example, an unobserved candidate mediator causes both positive emotions and donations, and it is this unobserved candidate mediator that creates the observed empathy -> positive emotions -> donations indirect effect (for more information about this problem, see some of the references added below).</p>

<p>In short, there is nothing wrong with doing a Sobel test or any other test of mediation with survey data.  However, just as when you examine simple bivariate relationships with survey data, such a test probably will not reveal much about causal mechanisms because the assumptions required to draw these conclusions are implausible at best.</p>

If the p-value is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05 usually) then you can be pretty confident that the slope is not zero and that there is likely to be a ""real"" relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The R-squared shows how much of the variation in y is explained by variation in x.

57748,1895.0,2,,56784.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p><strong>The basic results of chi-square goodness-of-fit testing can be understood hierarchically</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Level 0</strong>. The classical Pearson's chi-square test statistic for testing a multinomial sample against a fixed probability vector $p$ is
$$
X^2(p) = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(X^{(n)}_i - n p_i)^2}{n p_i} \stackrel{d}{\to} \chi_{k-1}^2 \&gt;,
$$
where $X_i^{(n)}$ denotes the number of outcomes in the $i$th cell out of a sample of size $n$. This can be fruitfully viewed as the squared norm of the vector $\mathbf Y_n =  (Y_1^{(n)},\ldots,Y_k^{(n)})$ where $Y_i^{(n)} = (X_i^{(n)} - n p_i)/\sqrt{n p_i}$ which, by the multivariate central limit theorem converges in distribution as
$$
\mathbf Y_n \stackrel{d}{\to} \mathcal N(0, \mathbf I - \sqrt{p}\sqrt{p}^T) \&gt;.
$$
From this we see that $X^2 = \|\mathbf Y_n\|^2 \to \chi^2_{k-1}$ since $\mathbf I - \sqrt{p}\sqrt{p}^T$ is idempotent of rank $k-1$.</p>

<p><strong>Level 1</strong>. At the next level of the hierarchy, we consider composite hypotheses with multinomial samples. Since the exact $p$ of interest is unknown under the null hypothesis, we have to estimate it. If the null hypothesis is composite and composed of a linear subspace of dimension $m$, then maximum likelihood estimates (or other efficient estimators) of the $p_i$ can be used as ""plug-in"" estimators. Then, the statistic
$$
X^2_1 = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(X^{(n)}_i - n \hat{p}_i)^2}{n \hat{p}_i} \stackrel{d}{\to} \chi_{k-m - 1}^2 \&gt;,
$$
under the null hypothesis.</p>

<p><strong>Level 2</strong>. Consider the case of goodness of fit testing of a parametric model where the cells are fixed and known in advance: For example, we have a sample from an exponential distribution with rate $\lambda$ and from this we produce a multinomial sample by binning over $k$ cells, then the above result still holds provided that we use efficient estimates (e.g., MLEs) <em>of the bin probabilities themselves using only the observed frequencies</em>.</p>

<p>If the number of parameters for the distribution is $m$ (e.g., $m = 1$ in the exponential case), then
$$
X^2_2 = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(X^{(n)}_i - n \hat{p}_i)^2}{n \hat{p}_i} \stackrel{d}{\to} \chi_{k-m - 1}^2 \&gt;,
$$
where here $\hat{p}_i$ can be taken to be the MLEs of the cell probabilities of the fixed, known cells corresponding to the given distribution of interest.</p>

<p><strong>Level 3</strong>. But, wait! If we have a sample $Z_1,\ldots,Z_n \sim F_\lambda$, why shouldn't we estimate $\lambda$ efficiently first, and then use a chi-square statistic with our fixed, known cells? Well, we can, but in general we no longer get a chi-square distribution for the corresponding chi-square statistic. In fact, Chernoff and Lehmann (1954) showed that using MLEs to estimate the parameters and then plugging them back in to get estimates of the cell probabilities results in a non-chi-square distribution, in general. Under suitable regularity conditions, the distribution is (stochastically) between a $\chi_{k-m-1}^2$ and a $\chi_{k-1}^2$ random variable, with the distribution depending on the parameters.</p>

<p>Untuitively, this means that the limiting distribution of $\mathbf Y_n$ is $\mathcal N(0, \mathbf I - \sqrt{p_\lambda}\sqrt{p_\lambda}^T - \mathbf A(\lambda))$.</p>

<p>We haven't even talked about <em>random</em> cell boundaries yet, and we're already in a bit of a tight spot! There are two ways out: One is to retreat back to Level 2, or at the very least <em>not</em> use efficient estimators (like MLEs) of the underlying parameters $\lambda$. The second approach is to try to undo the effects of $\mathbf A(\lambda)$ in such a way as to recover a chi-square distribution.</p>

<p>There are several ways of going the latter route. They basically amount to premultiplying $\mathbf Y_n$ by the ""right"" matrix $\mathbf B(\hat{\lambda})$. Then, the quadratic form 
$$
\mathbf Y_n^T \mathbf B^T \mathbf B \mathbf Y_n \stackrel{d}{\to} \chi_{k-1}^2 \&gt;,
$$
where $k$ is the number of cells.</p>

<p>Examples are the <em>Rao&ndash;Robson&ndash;Nikulin statistic</em> and the <em>Dzhaparidze&ndash;Nikulin statistic</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Level 4</strong>. Random cells. In the case of random cells, under certain regularity conditions, we end up in the same situation as in Level 3 if we take the route of modifying the Pearson chi-square statistic. Location-scale families, in particular, behave very nicely. One common approach is to take our $k$ cells each to have probability $1/k$, nominally. So, our random cells are intervals of the form $\hat{I}_j = \hat \mu + \hat\sigma I_{0,j}$ where $I_{0,j} = [F^{-1}((j-1)/k), F^{-1}(j/k))$. This result has been further extended to the case where the number of random cells grows with the sample size.</p>

<p>If the distribution of the population from which the sample is drawn is known, the distribution of the median may be computed. </p>

<p>The density of the $r$-th order statistic for a sample of size $n$ for a continuous random variable is</p>

<p>$$f_{Y_2}= 6F(x)[1-F(x)]f(x)$$</p>

<p>For even $n$ it's more complex, but sometimes still doable.</p>

<p>If the sample size is 1, the distribution of the median is trivial - it's just the distribution of a single observation.</p>

<p>If the density is available, it should be possible to compute the standard deviation of the distribution of the order statistic.</p>

<p>(If you don't know the distribution, it's also possible to get an asymptotic standard error for the median, but it relies on knowing the height of the density at the median, which - while a much weaker requirement - would seem unlikely unless you knew the distribution.)</p>

<p>Additionally, you can generate nonparametric intervals for a median from the order statistics, but I don't think this gets at your present problem.</p>

<p>I was trying to fit a GARCH(1,1) model to the variance of log returns of a series, and ARMA(0,0) for the mean. I was using the <code>fGarch</code> package in R to do this. The aim of the modeling is to generate a predicted volatility number to feed into the Black-Scholes model to an generate option price and therefore option deltas. I plan to backtest the delta from GARCH volatility to hedge my option positions (as opposed to deltas derived from implied vol prices).</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>A) I used the <code>predict</code> function in the package to generate a 'n-day ahead' volatility forecast. As I understand GARCH, these numbers are annualized standard deviation numbers. To hedge a 1 month option I want to forecast 30 day volatility. I can simply put 'n-days ahead = 30 to get the numbers, but <strong>how do I combine those 30 numbers to get a annualized vol number?</strong></p>

<p>B) Could anyone also please explain how to use the <code>nroll</code> argument in the package? Basically I want rolling GARCH estimates of volatility. For example, at day 10, I want to use the past 10 days of data to get a vol prediction for day 11, at day 50 I want to use 50 days of data for vol prediction of day 51 etc.</p>

<p>Moore (1971) said that Roy (1956) and Watson (1957,58,59) showed that when the cell boundaries 
for a chi-square statistic are functions of best asymptotic normal estimated parameter values, then under certain conditions, the asymptotic null distribution of the 
chi-square statistic is still that of a sum of a $\chi^2_{k-p-1}$ and a weighted 
sum of $p$ $\chi^2_1$ variables (for $k$ cells, $p$ parameters) 
where the weights are between 0 and 1 (making the cdf of the 
distribution between that of a $\chi^2_{k-p}$ and a $\chi^2_{k}$, as alluded to in my question for the distribution when using ML estimation), and the weights on those last $p$ terms are unaffected by that estimation.</p>

<p>For the first one, you might want to consider what $f'$ looks like (as a formula) between the sorted data values (it's discontinuous at the data values). How does it behave as you move through the data? Where does it change from below 0 to above 0?</p>

<p>Can you see how to show what will minimize $f$ now?</p>

<hr>

<p>For the second case, consider $f_k(t) = ( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i-t|^{k} )^{1/k}$ (you would need to argue that $f_k$ and $f$ share an argmin for a given $k$ - that is taking the $1/k$ power doesn't change the location of the minimum. Below (for the same data as above) $f_k$ is plotted for $k = 2,3,5,9,$ and $99$ (the ""$k=2$"" case is faint dotted grey at the top, the ""$k=99$"" case is purple near the bottom):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/80diF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The ""$k=2$"" case corresponds to least squares, while $k=1$ would be the previous example. As $k$ increases, it's getting 'pointier'. Can you figure where the 'point' is headed, and why? Can you work out $f_k'$? What happens to that as $k$ increases?</p>

A TPS is a rotational sensor with $\approx$ 90° of range and the output is like a potentiometer with full open being 5V (or sensor's input value) and initial opening being some value between 0 and 0.5V. I built a <a href=""http://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=44710"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">test bench with a PIC32 controller</a> to take a voltage measurement every 0.75° and the black line connects these measurements. </p>

<p>One of my products has a tendency to make localized, low amplitude variations away from (and under) the ideal line. <strong>This question is about my algorithm for quantifying these localized ""dips""; what is a good name or description</strong> for the process of measuring the dips? (full explanation follows) In the below picture, the dip occurs at the left third of the plot and is a marginal case whether I would pass or fail this part:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gfx2w.jpg"" alt=""Print out of a suspect part""></p>

<p>So I built a dip detector (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19269638"">stackoverflow qa about the algorithm</a>) to quantify my gut feeling. I initially thought I was measuring ""area"". This graph is based on the printout above and my attempt to explain the algorithm graphically. There is a dip lasting for 13 samples between 17 and 31:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5oXL.png"" alt=""Sampled data shown with the &quot;dip&quot; magnified""></p>

<p>Test data goes in an array and I make another array for ""rise"" from one data point to the next, which I call $deltas$. I use a library to get the average and standard deviation for $deltas$. </p>

<p>Analyzing the $deltas$ array is represented in the graph below, where the slope is removed from the above graph. Originally, I thought of this as ""normalizing"" or ""unitizing"" the data as the x axis are equal steps and I'm now solely working with the rise between data points. When researching this question, I recalled this is the derivative, $\frac {dy}{dx}$ of the original data.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FjzSS.png"" alt=""Analysis of the derivative...?""></p>

<p>I walk through $deltas$ to find sequences where there are 5 or more adjacent negative values. The blue bars are a series of data points who are below the average of all $deltas$. The values of the blue bars are:</p>

<p>$0.7 + 1.2 + 1.3 + 1.4 + 1.8 + 2.5 + 2.9 + 3.0 + 2.5 + 2.0 + 1.5 + 1.0 + 1.2$</p>

<p>They sum to $23$, which represents the area (or the integral). My first thought is ""I just integrated the derivative"" which should mean I get back the original data, though I'm certain there's a term for this.</p>

<p>The green line is the average of these ""below average values"" found via dividing the area by the length of the dip:  </p>

<p>$23 \div 13 = 1.77$</p>

<p>During the testing of 100+ parts, I came to decide that dips with my green line average less than $2.6$ are acceptable. Standard deviation calculated across the entire data set wasn't a strict enough test for these dips, as without enough total area, they still fell within the limit I established for good parts. I observationally chose standard deviation of $3.0$ to be the highest I would allow.</p>

<p>Setting a cutoff for standard deviation strict enough to fail this part would then be so strict as to fail parts which otherwise appear to have a great plot. I do also have a spike detector which fails the part if any $|deltas - avg| &gt; avg+std dev$. </p>

<p>It's been almost 20 years since Calc 1, so please go easy on me, but this <em>feels</em> a lot like when a professor used calculus and the displacement equation to explain how in racing, a competitor with less acceleration who maintains higher corner speed can beat another competitor having greater acceleration to the next turn: going through the previous turn faster, the higher initial speed means the area under his velocity (displacement) is greater.</p>

<p>To translate that to my question, I feel like my green line would be like acceleration, the 2nd derivative of the original data. </p>

<p>I visited wikipedia to re-read the fundamentals of calculus and the definitions of derivative and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">integral</a>, learned the proper term for adding up the area under a curve via discreet measurements as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Numerical Integration</a>.

<p>these ""similarity scores"" lie in between 0-1. What I am trying to do here is to combine these scores into a single score, also in between 0-1.</p>

<p>My issue here is that I am not able to figure out a good approach to combine these scores into this single score. So far I have tried taking the average, max. value, calculating row, column averages and using the max.value out of them. The problem with these scores is that the matrices I have vary a lot in row and column lengths, and I cannot account for this variation using average because at the end of the day I have to sort these matrices based on this similarity score and select n top ranking ones, and from manually checking these observations, I realized that max.value in a matrix is not a suitable single score the similarity between these observations. Do you have any suggestions for an approach to combine these scores ? </p>

<p>Also is there any statistical tests that could be applied on this combined score ? I have tried random sampling approach, but the steps to calculate similarity scores for the observations take a long time to run and iterating 
these steps ~1,000 times or more is not feasible now.   </p>

<p>PCA's loading matrix A is the matrix of correlations between the variables and the principal components. We may say it because row sums of squares are all 1 (the diagonal of R) while matrix sum of squares is the overall variance (trace of R). Cholesky root's elements of B are correlations too, because that matrix also has these two properties. Columns of B are not principal components of A, although they are ""components"", in a sense.</p>

<p>Both A and B can restore R and thus both can replace R, as its representation. B is triangular which clearly shows the fact that it captures the pairwise correlations of R sequentially, or hierarhically. Cholesky's component <code>I</code> correlates with all the variables and is the linear image of the first of them <code>V1</code>. Component <code>II</code> no more shares with <code>V1</code> but correlates with the last three... Finally <code>IV</code> is correlated only with the last, <code>V4</code>. I thought such sort of ""ranking"" is <em>perhaps what you seek for</em>?.</p>

<p>The problem with Cholesky decomposition, though, is that - unlike PCA - it depends on the order of items in the matrix R. Well, you might sort the items is descending or ascending order of the sum of squared elements (or, if you like, sum of absolute elements, or in order of multiple correlarion coefficient - see about it below). This order reflects the how much an item is gross correlated.</p>

<p>From last B matrix we see that <code>V2</code>, most grossly correlated item, pawns all its correlations in <code>I</code>. Next grossly correlated item <code>V1</code> pawns all its correlatedness, except that with <code>V2</code>, in <code>II</code>; and so on.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another decision could be computing <strong>Multiple correlation coefficient</strong> for every item and ranking based on its magnitude. Multiple correlation between an item and all the other items grows as the item correlates more with all of them but them correlate less with each other. The squared multiple correlation coefficients form the diagonal of the so called <em>image covariance matrix</em> which is $\bf S R^{-1} S - 2S + R$, where $\bf S$ is the diagonal matrix of the reciprocals of the diagonals of $\bf R^{-1}$.</p>

57768,2765.0,2,,52449.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>First, the appropriate definition of ""effective sample size"" is IMO linked to a quite specific question. If $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ are identically distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance 1 the empirical mean
$$\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n X_k$$
is an unbiased estimator of $\mu$. But what about its variance? For <em>independent</em> variables the variance is $n^{-1}$. For a weakly stationary time series, the variance of $\hat{\mu}$ is 
$$\frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{k, l=1}^n \text{cov}(X_k, X_l) = \frac{1}{n}\left(1 + 2\left(\frac{n-1}{n} \rho_1 + \frac{n-2}{n} \rho_2 + \ldots + \frac{1}{n} \rho_{n-1}\right) \right) \simeq \frac{\tau_a}{n}.$$
The approximation is valid for large enough $n$. If we define $n_{\text{eff}} = n/\tau_a$, the variance of the empirical mean for a weakly stationary time series is approximately $n_{\text{eff}}^{-1}$, which is the same variance as if we had $n_{\text{eff}}$ independent samples. Thus $n_{\text{eff}} = n/\tau_a$ is an appropriate definition if we ask for the variance of the empirical average. It might be inappropriate for other purposes. </p>

<p>With a negative correlation between observations it is certainly possible that the variance can become smaller than $n^{-1}$ ($n_{\text{eff}} &gt; n$). This is a well known variance reduction technique in Monto Carlo integration: If we introduce negative correlation between the variables instead of correlation 0, we can reduce the variance without increasing the sample size.</p>

<p>From my personal understanding ${\rm Cov}(X,Y)$ comes from that fact that $X$ and $Y$ are dependent random variables, that is, $E[XY]$ is not the same as $E[X]E[Y]$.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fQyvA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And rerun the correlation again, the results are identical. This exclusion does not just happen to system missing, if you have assigned a user-defined missing, the case with that user-defined missing will also be excluded.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IE7JA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>But wait...!</strong></p>

<p>I said that it's ""fine"" because it's true that SPSS does screen out incomplete cases for you. But it is in no way solving the missing phenomenon for you. If there is any systematic reason that causes your participants to not answer a certain question, you correlation coefficient can be wrong. However, if you feel that they missed the answer in a random manner, then your correlation shouldn't be heavily affected, though you may lose some sample size and consequently power.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>But - I ask you - please tell Tania about pairwise and listwise deletion of missings and under what button it is found in SPSS -- ttnphns</em></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Certainly. It would be necessary to illustrate with another example in which we have a new candidate, $x3$:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TSc85.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>SPSS correlation analysis uses pairwise deletion by default, which means it'd always maximize the number of case in each of the pairwise comparisons. We have learned from above that the correlation between $x1$ and $x2$ has a sample size of 8 pairs. What about $x1$ and $x3$?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vg59q.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Turned out, it's 9 because maximally there are 9 pairs of data. Now, this can get inconvenient if you'd like to screen off the whole case and prevent it from being analyzed. In that case, you'll use list-wise deletion.</p>

<p>To call the option up, in the Correlation menu, press <code>Option</code> and then check <code>Exclude cases listwise</code>, then press <code>Continute</code> and <code>OK</code> to submit the test again:</p>

<li>Typically, the best possible predictive performance is better for a nonlinear kernel (or at least as good as the linear one). </li>

<p>It's been shown that the <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.141.880&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"">linear kernel is a degenerate version of RBF</a>, hence the linear kernel is never more accurate than a properly tuned RBF kernel.

<blockquote>
  <p>The analysis also indicates that if complete model selection using the  Gaussian kernel has been conducted, there is no need to consider linear SVM.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the number of features is large, one may not need to map data to a higher dimensional space. That is, the nonlinear mapping does not improve the performance.
  Using the linear kernel is good enough, and one only searches for the parameter C.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your conclusion is more or less right but you have the argument backwards. In practice, the linear kernel tends to perform very well when the number of features is large (e.g. there is no need to map to an even higher dimensional feature space). A typical example of this is document classification, with thousands of dimensions in input space.</p>

<p>In those cases, nonlinear kernels are not necessarily significantly more accurate than the linear one. This basically means nonlinear kernels lose their appeal: they require way more resources to train with little to no gain in predictive performance, so why bother.</p>

<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>Always try linear first since it is way faster to train (AND test). If the accuracy suffices, pat yourself on the back for a job well done and move on to the next problem. If not, try a nonlinear kernel.</p>

57782,17670.0,1,57964.0,,,Logistic regression: maximizing true positives - false positives,<r><regression><logistic><classification><glmnet>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I have a logistic regression model (fit via glmnet in R with elastic net regularization), and I would like to maximize the difference between true positives and false positives.  In order to do this, the following procedure came to mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fit standard logistic regression model</li>
<li>Using prediction threshold as 0.5, identify all positive predictions</li>
<li>Assign weight 1 for positively predicted observations, 0 for all others</li>
<li>Fit weighted logistic regression model</li>
</ol>

<p>What would be the flaws with this approach?  What would be the correct way to proceed with this problem?</p>

<p>The reason for wanting to maximize the difference between the number of true positives and false negatives is due to the design of my application.  As part of a class project, I am building a autonomous participant in an online marketplace - if my model predicts it can buy something and sell it later at a higher price, it places a bid.  I would like to stick to logistic regression and output binary outcomes (win, lose) based on fixed costs and unit price increments (I gain or lose the same amount on every transaction).  A false positive hurts me because it means that I buy something and am unable to sell it for a higher price.  However, a false negative doesn't hurt me (only in terms of opportunity cost) because it just means if I didn't buy, but if I had, I would have made money.  Similarly, a true positive benefits me because I buy and then sell for a higher price, but a true negative doesn't benefit me because I didn't take any action.</p>

<p>I agree that the 0.5 cut-off is completely arbitrary, and when I optimized the model from step 1 on the prediction threshold which yields the highest difference between true/false positives, it turns out to be closer to 0.4.  I think this is due to the skewed nature of my data - the ratio between negatives and positives is about 1:3.</p>

<p>Right now, I am following the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Split data intto training/test</li>
<li>Fit model on training, make predictions in test set and compute difference between true/false positives</li>
<li>Fit model on full, make predictions in test set and compute difference between true/false positives</li>
</ol>

<p>The difference between true/false positives is smaller in step #3 than in step #2, despite the training set being a subset of the full set.  Since I don't care whether the model in #3 has more true negatives and less false negatives, is there anything I can do without altering the likelihood function itself?</p>

DF  = 7.4 + 7.5 + 3.1 = 18

<p>Evaluating the area to the right of the test statistic is .9, so in this circumstance we would either fail to reject the null hypothesis that the distribution of the runs are randomly distributed. It is fairly close to the other tail though, so it is borderline evidence the data is more dispersed than you would expect by chance (as this is one of those circumstances it makes sense to evaluate the left tail of the Chi-Square distribution).</p>

<p>I did not get any answer there but I think now here is a better place to ask this question since it is more about ""the philosophy"", not the calculations involved in the concept, which is what the ""math"" board likes more.</p>

<p>I am trying to gain a good understanding of Bayesian Networks and the first thing I want to understand exactly is how they are built. I see that these networks are built on conditional independence assumptions in order to simplify joint distributions and they are built commonly by using causal relationships since they imply conditional independence given the direct causes. What I still don't understand is why these networks assume a Directed Acyclic (DAG) structure? </p>

<p>There can be systems which contain circular causality relationships. For example, let's think of a hypothetical machine consisting of two parallel plates which rub together. We think of three variables ""Heat"", ""Plate Area Expansion"" and ""Friction"". Plate Area Expansion is the effect of the cause ""Heat"" and ""Friction"" is just the effect of the plate area expansion since larger area means larger amount of friction, in turn. But if we think of it, ""Friction"" also causes an increase in the heat level, so ""Friction"" is a direct cause of ""Heat"" as well. This circular causality ends up with the following diagram:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sNNga.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sNNga.png"" alt=""Diagram""></a>
</p>

<p>This is a Directed Cyclic Graph and violates acyclicity (DAG) assumptions on which the whole Bayesian Network idea is founded. So, how can be such systems with circular causes, feedbacks and loops represented with Bayesian Networks? It is surely not possible that the DAG theory does not support such systems because this ""feedback"" mechanism is a quite common and basic thing. But I just cannot see how those kinds of systems are represented with acyclic graphs and I am sure that I am missing something here. I want to know what I am just missing.</p>

<p><strong>Frequentist</strong>:  &quot;Hello, Machine Learner!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: &quot;I hear you guys are good at stuff.  Here's some data.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Yes, let's write down a model and then calculate the MLE.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;Hey, F, that's not what you told me yesterday!  I had some univariate data and I wanted to estimate the variance, and I calculated the MLE.  Then you pounced on me and told me to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction"" rel=""noreferrer"">divide by <span class=""math-container"">$n-1$</span> instead of by <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span></a>.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Ah yes, thanks for reminding me.  I often think that I'm supposed to use the MLE for everything, but I'm interested in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biased_estimator"" rel=""noreferrer"">unbiased estimators</a> and so on.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;Eh, what's this philosophizing about?  Will it help me?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot; OK, an <em>estimator</em> is a black box, you put data in and it gives you some numbers out.  We frequentists don't care about how the box was constructed, about what principles were used to design it.  For example, I don't know how to derive the <span class=""math-container"">$\div(n-1)$</span> rule.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot; So, what do you care about?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Evaluation.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;I like the sound of that.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;A black box is a black box.  If somebody claims a particular estimator is an unbiased estimator for <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span>, then we try many values of <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span> in turn, generate many samples from each based on some assumed model, push them through the estimator, and find the average <em>estimated <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span></em>.  If we can prove that the expected estimate equals the true value, for all values, then we say it's unbiased.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;Sounds great!  It sounds like frequentists are pragmatic people.  You judge each black box by its results.  Evaluation is key.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Indeed!  I understand you guys take a similar approach.  Cross-validation, or something?  But that sounds messy to me.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;Messy?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;The idea of testing your estimator on real data seems dangerous to me.  The empirical data you use might have all sorts of problems with it, and might not behave according the model we agreed upon for evaluation.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;What?  I thought you said you'd proved some results?  That your estimator would always be unbiased, for all <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span>.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Yes.  While your method might have worked on one dataset (the dataset with train and test data) that you used in your evaluation, I can prove that mine will always work.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;For all datasets?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;So my method has been cross-validated on one dataset.  You haven't test yours on any real dataset?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;That's right.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;That puts me in the lead then!  My method is better than yours.  It predicts cancer 90% of the time.  Your 'proof' is only valid if the entire dataset behaves according to the model you assumed.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Emm, yeah, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;And that interval has 95% <em>coverage</em>.  But I shouldn't be surprised if it only contains the correct value of <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span> 20% of the time?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;That's right.  Unless the data is truly i.i.d Normal (or whatever), my proof is useless.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;So my evaluation is more trustworthy and comprehensive? It only works on the datasets I've tried so far, but at least they're real datasets, warts and all.  There you were, trying to claim you were more 'conservative' and 'thorough' and that you were interested in model-checking and stuff.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: (interjects) &quot;Hey guys, Sorry to interrupt.  I'd love to step in and balance things up, perhaps demonstrating some other issues, but I really love watching my frequentist colleague squirm.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Woah!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;OK, children.  It was all about evaluation.  An estimator is a black box.  Data goes in, data comes out.  We approve, or disapprove, of an estimator based on how it performs under evaluation.  We don't care about the 'recipe' or 'design principles' that are used.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Yes.  But we have very different ideas about which evaluations are important.  ML will do train-and-test on real data.  Whereas I will do an evaluation that is more general (because it involves a broadly-applicable proof) and also more limited (because I don't know if your dataset is actually drawn from the modelling assumptions I use while designing my evaluation.)&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;What evaluation do you use, B?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: (interjects) &quot;Hey. Don't make me laugh. He doesn't evaluate anything.  He just uses his subjective beliefs and runs with it.  Or something.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;That's the common interpretation.  But it's also possible to define Bayesianism by the evaluations preferred.  Then we can use the idea that none of us care what's in the black box, we care only about different ways to evaluate.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> continues:   &quot;Classic example:  Medical test.  The result of the blood test is either Positive or Negative.  A frequentist will be interested in, of the Healthy people, what proportion get a Negative result.  And similarly, what proportion of Sick people will get a Positive. The frequentist will calculate these for each blood testing method that's under consideration and then recommend that we use the test that got the best pair of scores.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Exactly. What more could you want?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;What about those individuals that got a Positive test result?  They will want to know 'of those that get a Positive result, how many will get Sick?' and 'of those that get a Negative result, how many are Healthy?' &quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;Ah yes, that seems like a better pair of questions to ask.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;HERESY!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;Here we go again.  He doesn't like where this is going.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;This is about 'priors', isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;EVIL&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;Anyway, yes, you're right ML.  In order to calculate the proportion of Positive-result people that are Sick you must do one of two things.  One option is to run the tests on lots of people and just observe the relevant proportions. How many of those people go on to die of the disease, for example.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;That sounds like what I do.  Use train-and-test.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;But you can calculate these numbers in advance, if you are willing to make an assumption about the rate of Sickness in the population.  The frequentist also makes his calcuations in advance, but without using this population-level Sickness rate.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>:  &quot;MORE UNFOUNDED ASSUMPTIONS.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;Oh shut up.  Earlier, you were found out.  ML discovered that you are just as fond of unfounded assumptions as anyone.  Your 'proven' coverage probabilities won't stack up in the real world unless all your assumptions stand up.  Why is my prior assumption so diffent?  You call me crazy, yet you pretend your assumptions are the work of a conservative, solid, assumption-free analysis.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> (continues): &quot;Anyway, ML, as I was saying. Bayesians like a different kind of evaluation.  We are more interested in conditioning on the observed data, and calculating the accuracy of our estimator accordingly.  We cannot perform this <em>evaluation</em> without using a prior.  But the interesting thing is that, once we decide on this form of evaluation, and once we choose our prior, we have an automatic 'recipe' to create an appropriate estimator.  The frequentist has no such recipe.  If he wants an unbiased estimator for a complex model, he doesn't have any automated way to build a suitable estimator.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;And you do? You can automatically build an estimator?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;Yes.  I don't have an automatic way to create an unbiased estimator, because I think bias is a bad way to evaluate an estimator.  But given the conditional-on-data estimation that I like, and the prior, I can connect the prior and the likelihood to give me the estimator.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;So anyway, let's recap.  We all have different ways to evaluate our methods, and we'll probably never agree on which methods are best.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;Well, that's not fair.  We could mix and match them.  If any of us have good labelled training data, we should probably test against it.  And generally we all should test as many assumptions as we can.  And some 'frequentist' proofs might be fun too, predicting the performance under some presumed model of data generation.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Yeah guys.  Let's be pragmatic about evaluation.  And actually, I'll stop obsessing over infinite-sample properties.  I've been asking the scientists to give me an infinite sample, but they still haven't done so.  It's time for me to focus again on finite samples.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;So, we just have one last question.  We've argued a lot about how to <em>evaluate</em> our methods, but how do we <em>create</em> our methods.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;Ah. As I was getting at earlier, we Bayesians have the more powerful general method.  It might be complicated, but we can always write some sort of algorithm (maybe a naive form of MCMC) that will sample from our posterior.&quot;</p>
<p>F(interjects): &quot;But it might have bias.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;So might your methods.  Need I remind you that the MLE is often biased?  Sometimes, you have great difficulty finding unbiased estimators, and even when you do you have a stupid estimator (for some really complex model) that will say the variance is negative.  And you call that unbiased.  Unbiased, yes.  But useful, no!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;OK guys. You're ranting again.  Let me ask you a question, F.  Have you ever compared the bias of your method with the bias of B's method, when you've both worked on the same problem?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;Yes.  In fact, I hate to admit it, but B's approach sometimes has lower bias and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSE</a> than my estimator!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;The lesson here is that, while we disagree a little on evaluation, none of us has a monopoly on how to create estimator that have properties we want.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: &quot;Yes, we should read each other's work a bit more.  We can give each other inspiration for estimators.  We might find that other's estimators work great, out-of-the-box, on our own problems.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>: &quot;And I should stop obsessing about bias.  An unbiased estimator might have ridiculous variance.  I suppose all of us have to 'take responsibility' for the choices we make in how we evaluate and the properties we wish to see in our estimators.  We can't hind behind a philosophy.  Try all the evaluations you can.  And I will keep sneaking a look at the Bayesian literature to get new ideas for estimators!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>:&quot;In fact, a lot of people don't really know what their own philosophy is.  I'm not even sure myself.  If I use a Bayesian recipe, and then proof some nice theoretical result, doesn't that mean I'm a frequentist?  A frequentist cares about above proofs about performance, he doesn't care about recipes.  And if I do some train-and-test instead (or as well), does that mean I'm a machine-learner?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ML</strong>: &quot;It seems we're all pretty similar then.&quot;</p>

57799,5237.0,2,,57790.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I suspect your problem is you are using stepwise model selection.  Automatic model selection algorithms, such as stepwise selection, don't have any 'knowledge' about what the variables <em>mean</em> or how they <em>ought</em> to relate to each other.  For example, it is standard advice that if you include a squared term (e.g., $X_j^2$) in a model, you should include the lower level term ($X_j$) as well, even if it's not 'significant'.  However, the selection algorithm doesn't know there is any relationship between the two variables, and so you commonly have situations where it will throw out the lower level term but retain the squared term.  Likewise, <em>all</em> levels of your categorical variable should be retained or excluded together, but the stepwise algorithm doesn't necessarily 'know' that.  I believe this is your problem.  </p>

<p>Of course, even if you were to address this issue, stepwise selection algorithms are a truly horrible modeling strategy, and still should not be used.

<p>As the above suggests, the way to rectify this problem is to stop using stepwise selection.  Aside from the problem described in the post, it does not do what people believe it does (i.e., tell them which variables are the 'real' or 'important' ones).  </p>

<hr>

<p>Based on your edit, I'm guessing there may be a different issue.  It is possible that you don't have any observations (cases) with those levels of the categorical variable for those countries.  You should check to see if that is the case.  If so, see if one of the other levels of the categorical variable has instances for every country, and use that one as your reference level instead.  </p>

Depending on your target audience or readership, the consequence may range from practitioner puzzlement to statistician flak. </p>

<p>Your general model I take to be a sum of power functions. With some change of notation that could be  </p>

<p>$y = b_0 + \sum_{j=1}^J b_j x_j^{k_j}$ </p>

<p>with additive error. As @Glen_b comments, the usual approach to fitting such a model would be to use nonlinear least squares, which I take to be well supported in SAS, although I can't advise on details. </p>

<p>In many ways a simpler model is a multiplicative power function </p>

<p>$y = B_0 \prod_{j=1}^J x_j^{b_j}$, from which </p>

<p>$\ln y = b_0 + \sum_{j=1}^J b_j \ln x_j$, where $\ln B_0 =: b_0$. </p>

<p>That model is easy to fit by least squares as it is just multiple regression on the logged variables. Error with this is taken to be multiplicative on the original scale and additive on a logarithmic scale, which is often about right. A virtue of this model, as with power functions taken singly, is that it can be consistent with the limiting behaviour that $y$ tends to 0 as all the $x$s tend to 0, often important economically (physically, biologically). (However, the assumption is that all data are positive. Your own approach appears consistent with occasional zeros but not with negative values.) </p>

<p>More generally, however, we have no sight of your data and only a hint of what the regressors or predictors are, so it is difficult to say much more except to guess that your response variable is probably something zero or positive. If so,  it is helpful to ensure that predictions are always positive for all data points. I can't see that is guaranteed by your present approach. </p>

<p>On a terminology question: I'd advise against calling any of these models a polynomial, even if  you spell out very clearly that the powers are in general not integers. Either people don't know what a polynomial is or they will expect the powers to be integers, at least as a mathematical default: there is some obscurity either way, better avoided. </p>

57824,13895.0,2,,34166.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I just re-tripped across this. I've refined some of my thoughts since that last post, and thought I might find a receptive audience for them here.</p>

<p>First off, on the philosophy of how to address such a controversy: Say arguments A and B exist. Each has a premise, a sequence of deductions, and a result; and the results differ.</p>

<p>The best way way to prove one argument is incorrect is to invalidate one of its deductions. If that were possible here, there wouldn't be a controversy. Another is to disprove the premise, but you can't do that directly. You can argue for why you don’t believe one, but that won't resolve anything unless you can convince others to stop believing it.</p>

<p>To prove a premise wrong indirectly, you have to form an alternate sequence of deductions from it that leads to an absurdity or to a contradiction of the premise. The fallacious way is to argue that the opposing result violates your premise. That means that one is wrong, but it doesn't indicate which.</p>

<p>+++++</p>

<p>The halfer's premise is ""no new information."" Their sequence of deductions is empty - none are needed. Pr(Heads|Awake) = Pr(Heads)=1/2.</p>

<p>The thirders (specifically, Elga) have two premises - that Pr(H1|Awake and Monday) = Pr(T1|Awake and Monday), and Pr(T1|Awake and Tails) = Pr(T2|Awake and Tails). An incontrovertible sequence of deductions then leads to Pr(Heads|Awake) = 1/3.</p>

<p>Note that the thirders don't ever assume there is new information - their premises are based on whatever information exists - ""new"" or not - when SB is awake. And I've never seen anyone argue for why a thirder premise is wrong, except that it violates the halfer result. So the halfers have provided none of the valid arguments I've listed. Just the fallacious one.</p>

<p>But there are other deductions possible from ""no new information,"" with a sequence of deductions that start with Pr(Heads|Awake) = 1/2. One is that Pr(Heads|Awake and Monday) = 2/3 and Pr(Tails|Awake and Monday) = 1/3. This does contradict the thirder premise, but like I said, that doesn’t help the halfer cause since it still could be their premise that is wrong. Ironically, this result does prove something - that the halfer premise contradicts itself. On Sunday, SB says Pr(Heads|Monday) = Pr(Tails|Monday), so adding the information ""Awake"" has allowed her to update these probabilities. It is new information.</p>

<p>So I have proven the halfer premise can't be right. That doesn't mean the thirders are right, but it does mean that halfers have not provided any contrary evidence.</p>

<p>+++++</p>

<p>There is another argument I find more convincing. It isn't completely original, but I'm not sure if the proper viewpoint has been emphasized enough. Consider a variation of the experiment: SB is always wakened on both days; usually it is in a room that is painted blue, but on Tuesday after Heads it is in a room that is painted red. What should she say the probability of Heads is, if she finds herself awake in a blue room?</p>

<p>I don’t think anybody would seriously argue that it is anything but 1/3. There are three situations that could correspond to her current one, all are equally likely, and only one includes Heads.</p>

<p>The salient point is that there is no difference between this version, and the original. What she ""knows"" - her ""new information"" - is that it is not H2. It does not matter how, or <strong><em>IF</em></strong>, she would know it could be H2 if it could. Her capability to observe situations that she knows do not apply is irrelevant if she knows they do not apply.</p>

<p>I can not believe the halfer premise. It is based on a fact - that she can't observe H2 - that cannot matter since she can, and does, observe that it isn't H2.</p>

<p>So I hope that I have provided a convincing argument for why the halfer premise is invalid. Along the way, I know I have demonstrated that the thirder result must be correct.</p>

<p>Since most of your attributes are categorical rather than continuous, you've probably used dummy or effects coding in your model (and if you haven't, you should).  If you've used dummy coding, the utility of each design-coded parameter can be interpreted relative to the excluded reference level.  For example, if you used ""no keyboard"" as the reference level for the keyboard attribute, the coefficient on the ""with keyboard"" parameter represents the incremental utility associated with adding a keyboard.  The same applies to the colour attribute: the coefficient on the different dummy-coded parameters represents the incremental utility of a particular colour relative to the excluded colour.</p>

<p>Note that the interpretation of the coefficients on dummy-coded (0,1) and effects-coded (-1,1) parameters are slightly different.  The coefficient on an effects coded parameter represents the deviation of the ‘level mean utility’ from ‘overall mean utility’, which not necessarily the same as the difference from the reference level as with a dummy-coded parameter.  Dummy-coded parameters are a little easier to interpret, but you run into problems with confounding between the utility of the reference levels and the alternative-specific constant (i.e. the intercept).

<p>Your study would only be a (quasi-)experimental design if there were some aspect of randomization in assignment to treatment. Based on the information you've provided, you are dealing with an observational study because the units self-assigned to treatment. This means that there are measurable and unmeasurable features of the observations that differ systematically between units in G1 and G2. In a school setting, there are essential features of students who go to state schools and those who go to private schools. Ideally (but probably not practically) you could control for these differences. I am skeptical because there are probably unmeasurable differences between the populations, such as motivation, family support and upbringing. These are things you cannot control for.</p>

<p>The key feature of any experiment is random assignment to treatment. If units are selected at random to receive treatment and then all units adhere to their assignment, then in expectation all treatment units and control units will be similar in their pre-treatment characteristics. Then the researcher can credibly infer that any post-treatment differences are due to the effect of treatment.</p>

<p>An ""experiment"" involves an intervention by a researcher that randomly assigns treatment. In my line of work, random selection is only possible in a very limited range of research designs. As a result, I do not consider it a requirement for a ""good"" or ""true"" experiment in my field.</p>

<p>A ""natural experiment"" involves randomized assignment to treatment through an intervention executed by something (human or not) other than the researcher. </p>

<p>In my experience, ""quasi-experiment"" refers to a research design where there is some aspect of randomness to assignment to treatment but not to a degree where the researcher believes that treatment and control units are similar in expectation in terms of pre-treatment features. This term, however, is quite vague and subject to different meanings. In my field people advise against its use. I've heard some claim it's too vague to be useful, obscuring more than it reveals about the research design. I've also heard some claim that ""quasi-experiment"" is just a euphemism for ""bad experiment."" I agree with the former sentiment and tend to disagree with the latter. </p>

<p>An ""observational study"" involves no randomized assignment to treatment. In these settings a researcher must try to  establish ""conditional ignorability."" The term means that after controlling for a set of covariates $X$, a unit's potential outcomes are conditionally independent from assignment to treatment.  In other words, the treatment assignment and the potential outcomes are conditionally independent given $X$ if and only if, given knowledge that $X=x$, knowledge of whether $T=\{0,1\}$ provides no information on the likelihood of a particular outcome in $Y$.</p>

<p>That is, conditional on the covariates, the treatment is independent of the potential outcomes.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
(Y(T=1),Y(T=0))⊥T|X
\end{equation}</p>

<p>A ""correlational <em>study</em>"" would probably not be of much value. A ""correlational <em>analysis</em>,"" however, probably means that you present exploratory data analysis that shows the unadjusted relationship between variables. In other words, <em>without any claim of causality</em>, you are showing how variables tend to move together in your data set.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My Working So Far:</strong> </p>

<p>The joint posterior distribution is given by:
\begin{align*}
 p(\mu_{1:T}, \theta \mid y_{1:T}) &amp; \propto p(\mu_{1:T}, \theta, y_{1:T}) \\
 &amp; = \underbrace{p(y_{1:T} \mid \mu_{1:T}, \theta)}_{\text{'likelihood'}}\underbrace{p(\mu_{1:T} \mid \theta)p(\theta)}_{\text{prior}} \\
&amp;  = \left[\prod_{t=1}^{T} p(y_t \mid \mu_t, \theta)\right]\left[\prod_{t=1}^{T-1}p(\mu_{t+1} \mid \mu_t, \theta) \right]p(\mu_1 \mid \theta)p(\theta) \ \ \cdots \ \ (1)
\end{align*}
Since $y_t \mid \mu_t, \theta \sim N(\mu_t, \tau^2)$ for $t=1, 2, \cdots, T$, the pdf is given by:
\begin{gather*}
p(y_t \mid \mu_t, \theta) = \left(2\pi \tau^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\tau^2}\left(y_t - \mu_t\right)^2  \right]
\end{gather*}
Similarly, $\mu_{t+1} \mid \mu_t, \theta \sim N\left(\phi \mu_t, 1 \right)$, so the pdf is given by:
\begin{gather*}
p(\mu_{t+1} \mid \mu_t, \theta) = \left(2\pi\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\mu_{t+1} - \phi \mu_t \right)^2 \right]
\end{gather*}
We know that $\mu_1 \mid \theta \sim N\left(0, \frac{1}{1-\phi^2} \right)$, so the pdf is given by:
\begin{gather*}
p(\mu_1 \mid \theta) = \left(2\pi\left(\frac{1}{1-\phi^2} \right) \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-\frac{\mu_1^2}{2\left(\frac{1}{1-\phi^2}\right)} \right]
\end{gather*}
Finally, we are given that $p\left(\theta\right) \propto \frac{1}{\tau}$.</p>

<p>Substituting all of the above into Eqn. $(1)$, yields the joint posterior distribution:
\begin{align*}
p(\mu_{1:T}, \theta \mid y_{1:T}) &amp; \propto \left[\prod_{t=1}^{T} \left(2\pi \tau^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\tau^2}\left(y_t - \mu_t\right)^2  \right]\right]\left[\prod_{t=1}^{T-1}\left(2\pi\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\mu_{t+1} - \phi \mu_t \right)^2 \right] \right] \\
&amp; \times \left(2\pi\left(\frac{1}{1-\phi^2} \right) \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-\frac{\mu_1^2}{2\left(\frac{1}{1-\phi^2}\right)} \right] \left( \frac{1}{\tau}\right)
\end{align*}</p>

<p>I will implement a ""blocked"" Gibbs sampler sampling $\mu_{1:T}^{(i)}$ together, as follows:</p>

<p>For $i = 1, 2, \cdots, M$, sample:
\begin{align*}
\mu_{1:T}^{(i)} &amp; \sim \mu_{1:T} \mid \phi^{(i-1)}, \tau^{(i-1)}, y_{1:T} \ \ \cdots \ \ (2)\\
\phi^{(i)} &amp; \sim \phi \mid \mu_{1:T}^{(i)}, \tau^{(i-1)}, y_{1:T} \ \ \cdots \ \ (3) \\
\tau^{(i)} &amp; \sim \tau \mid \mu_{1:T}^{(i)}, \phi^{(i)}, y_{1:T} \ \ \cdots \ \ (4)
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Sampling from $(2)$ is straightforward by using the Forward Filter Backwards Sampling <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward%E2%80%93backward_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">(FFBS)</a></p>

<p>Consider the following AR(1) model:
\begin{align*}
y_{t+1} = \phi y_t + \sigma \eta_t  \ \ \cdots (a)
\end{align*}
for $t = 1, 2, \cdots, T$ where
\begin{align*}
\eta_t \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0,1) \ \ \cdots (b)
\end{align*}
with $\eta_1$ independent of $y_k$ for $k \le t$, and where
\begin{align*}
y_1 \sim N\left(0, \frac{\sigma^2}{1-\phi^2}\right) \ \ \cdots (c)
\end{align*}
Define $\theta = (\phi, \sigma)$ and consider a prior distribution given by:
\begin{align*}
p(\theta) \propto \frac{1}{\sigma} \ \text{for} \ \infty &lt; \phi &lt; \infty \ \text{and} \ 0&lt;\sigma&lt;\infty \ \ \cdots (1)
\end{align*}
Also define the conditional likelihood function to be:
\begin{align*}
p(y_{2:T} \mid y_1, \theta) = \left(2\pi \sigma^2 \right)^{-\frac{T-1}{2}}\exp\left[- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{t=2}^T \left(y_t - \phi y_{t-1} \right)^2\right] \ \ \cdots (2)
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Show that the conditional posterior distribution, corresponding to the conditional likelihood function in $(2)$ and the prior density in $(1)$, may be obtained analytically, whereas the full posterior distribution, corresponding to the model in $(a)-(c)$ and the prior density in $(1)$, requires an alternative computational approach.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My Working:</strong> So firstly, I worked out the likelihood function corresponding to the AR(1) model described by $(a)-(c)$. My working is as follows:</p>

<p>We are given $y_1 \sim N\left(0, \frac{\sigma^2}{1-\phi^2}\right)$, so the pdf is given by:
\begin{align*}
p(y_1 \mid \theta) = \left(2\pi\left( \frac{\sigma^2}{1-\phi^2}\right) \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\exp\left[ - \frac{y_1^2}{2\left(\frac{\sigma^2}{1-\phi^2}\right)} \right]
\end{align*}
Conditionally, we have $y_2 \mid y_1 \sim N\left( \phi y_1, \sigma^2\right)$, so the pdf is given by:
\begin{align*}
p(y_2 \mid y_1, \theta) = \left(2\pi \sigma^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \left(y_2 - \phi y_1\right)^2 \right]
\end{align*}
Similarly, $y_3 \mid y_2, y_1 \equiv y_3 \mid y_2 \sim N\left(\phi y_2, \sigma^2\right)$, so the pdf is given by:
\begin{align*}
p(y_3 \mid y_2, y_1, \theta) = \left(2\pi \sigma^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \left(y_3 - \phi y_2\right)^2 \right]
\end{align*}
So in general, $y_t \mid y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \cdots, y_1 \equiv y_t \mid y_{t-1} \sim N\left(\phi y_{t-1}, \sigma^2\right)$, with pdf:
\begin{align*}
p(y_t \mid y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \cdots, y_1, \theta) = \left(2\pi \sigma^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \left(y_t - \phi y_{t-1}\right)^2 \right]
\end{align*}
Using the method of composition, we have:
\begin{align*}
p(y_{1:T} \mid \theta) &amp; = p(y_1 \mid \theta)p(y_2 \mid y_1, \theta)p(y_3 \mid y_1, y_2, \theta) \cdots p(y_T \mid y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_{T-1}, \theta) \\
&amp; = p(y_1 \mid \theta) \prod_{t=2}^T p(y_t \mid y_{t-1}, \theta)
\end{align*}
Thus the likelihood function computed for a given value of $\theta = \left(\phi, \sigma^2\right)$, is given by:
\begin{align}
 L(\theta) &amp; = \left\{ \left(2\pi\left( \frac{\sigma^2}{1-\phi^2}\right) \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\exp\left[ - \frac{y_1^2}{2\left(\frac{\sigma^2}{1-\phi^2}\right)} \right]\right\} \prod_{t=2}^T \left(2\pi \sigma^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \left(y_t - \phi y_{t-1}\right)^2 \right] \\
&amp;  \propto (1-\phi^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\sigma^{-T} \exp\left[-\frac{\sum_{t=2}^T\left(y_t - \phi y_{t-1}\right)^2+y_1^2\left(1-\phi^2\right)}{2\sigma^2} \right] \ \ \cdots (W1)
\end{align}</p>

<p>Deriving the conditional likelihood given in $(2)$ can be done as follows:
\begin{align*}
p(y_{2:T} \mid y_1, \theta) &amp; = \frac{p(y_{1:T} \mid \theta)}{p(y_1 \mid \theta)} \\
&amp; = \prod_{t=2}^T p(y_t \mid y_{t-1}, \theta) \\
&amp; = \left(2\pi \sigma^2 \right)^{-\frac{T-1}{2}}\exp\left[- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{t=2}^T \left(y_t - \phi y_{t-1} \right)^2  \right]
\end{align*}</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My Query:</strong> I don't really get what the question is trying to ask me to do? What does it mean by conditional posterior? Full posterior? Any assistance will be appreciated!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT 1 PROGRESS:</strong> Okay, so I've played around a bit more and made a bit of progress. I interpret 'conditional posterior' as follows:</p>

<p>Notice that when $T$ is large, then the factor $(1-\phi^2)$ in Eqn. $(W1)$ is small, so we can approximate the full likelihood with the conditional likelihood:
\begin{align*}
p(y_{2:T} \mid y_1, \theta) \propto \sigma^{-(T-1)}\exp\left[- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{t=2}^T \left(y_t - \phi y_{t-1} \right)^2  \right]
\end{align*}
So under the prior $p(\theta) \propto \frac{1}{\sigma}$, we have:
\begin{align*}
p(\theta \mid y_{1:T}) &amp; \propto \sigma^{-T}\exp\left[- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{t=2}^T \left(y_t - \phi y_{t-1} \right)^2  \right] \\
&amp; = \sigma^{-T}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{t=2}^T \left(y_t^2 -2y_t \phi y_{t-1} + \phi^2 y_{t-1}^2 \right) \right] \\
&amp; = \sigma^{-T}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left(\underbrace{\sum_{t=2}^Ty_t^2}_{C} - 2\phi\underbrace{\sum_{t=2}^Ty_t y_{t-1}}_{B} + \phi^2 \underbrace{\sum_{t=2}^T y_{t-1}^2}_{A} \right) \right]
\end{align*}
First, note that:
\begin{align*}
p(\phi \mid \sigma, y_{1:T}) &amp; \propto \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left(C-2\phi B + \phi^2A \right) \right] \\
&amp; = \exp\left[-\frac{A}{2\sigma^2} \left(\phi^2 - 2\phi \frac{B}{A} + \frac{C}{A} \right) \right] \\
&amp; = \exp\left[-\frac{A}{2\sigma^2}\left(\left(\phi - \frac{B}{A} \right)^2-\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)^2 + \frac{C}{A} \right) \right] \\
&amp; \propto \exp\left[-\frac{A}{2\sigma^2}\left(\phi-\frac{B}{A}\right)^2 \right] \\
&amp; = \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\left(\frac{\sigma^2}{A} \right)}\left(\phi-\frac{B}{A}\right)^2 \right]
\end{align*}
So the distribution of $\phi \mid \sigma, y_{1:T}$ is given by:
\begin{gather}
 \phi \mid \sigma, y_{1:T} \sim N\left(\frac{B}{A}, \frac{\sigma^2}{A} \right) \\
 \implies \phi \mid \sigma, y_{1:T} \sim  N\left(\frac{\sum_{t=2}^T y_t y_{t-1}}{\sum_{t=2}^T y_{t-1}^2}, \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{t=2}^T y_{t-1}^2} \right)
\end{gather}
Next, note that:
\begin{align*}
p(\sigma \mid y_{1:T}) &amp; \propto \int_{\phi} \sigma^{-T} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{t=2}^T \left(y_t - \phi y_{t-1}\right)^2 \right]d\phi \\
&amp; = \sigma^{-T} \int_{\phi} \exp\left[-\frac{A}{2\sigma^2} \left(\left(\phi - \frac{B}{A} \right)^2 - \left(\frac{B}{A}\right)^2 + \frac{C}{A} \right) \right]d\phi \\
&amp; = \sigma^{-T} \int_{\phi} \exp\left[-\frac{A}{2\sigma^2} \left(\phi - \frac{B}{A} \right)^2 + \left(\frac{A}{2\sigma^2}\right) \left(\frac{B}{A}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{A}{2\sigma^2}\right)\left(\frac{C}{A}\right) \right]d\phi \\
&amp; = \sigma^{-T} \exp\left[\frac{B^2/A - C}{2\sigma^2} \right] \int_{\phi} \exp\left[-\frac{A}{2\sigma^2} \left(\phi - \frac{B}{A} \right)^2\right] d\phi \\
&amp; = \sigma^{-T} \exp\left[\frac{B^2/A - C}{2\sigma^2} \right] \left(2\pi\left(\frac{\sigma^2}{A} \right) \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
&amp; \propto \frac{1}{\sigma^{(T-2)+1}}\exp\left[\frac{B^2/A - C}{2\sigma^2} \right]
\end{align*}
Now define $b = \frac{B}{A}$, notice:
\begin{align*}
Q(y_{2:T}, b) &amp; = \sum_{t=2}^T \left(y_t - b y_{t-1}\right)^2 \\
&amp; = \sum_{t=2}^T \left(y_t^2 - 2y_t b y_{t-1} + b^2 y_{t-1}^2 \right) \\
&amp; = \sum_{t=2}^T y_t^2 - 2b\sum_{t=2}^T y_t y_{t-1} + b^2 \sum_{t=2}^T y_{t-1}^2 \\
&amp; = C - 2bB+b^2A
\end{align*}
Then clearly,
\begin{align*}
-Q(y_{2:T}, b) = B^2/A-C
\end{align*}
So the distribution of $\sigma \mid y_{1:T}$ is given by:
\begin{gather}
\sigma \mid y_{1:T} \sim IG\left(v = T-2, \widehat{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{T-2} \left(B^2/A - C \right) \right) \\
 \implies \sigma \mid y_{1:T} \sim IG\left(v = T-2, \widehat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{T-2} \left(\frac{\left(\sum_{t=2}^T y_t y_{t-1} \right)^2}{\sum_{t=2}^T y_{t-1}^2} - \sum_{t=2}^T y_t^2 \right) \right)
\end{gather}
Or equivalently:
\begin{gather*}
\sigma \mid y_{1:T} \sim IG\left(v = T-2, \widehat{\sigma^2} = -\frac{1}{T-2}Q(y_{2:T}, b) \right)
\end{gather*}
Thus, we can derive the conditional posterior distribution analytically as:
\begin{align*}
p(\phi, \sigma \mid y_{1:T}) = p(\phi \mid \sigma,  y_{1:T})p(\sigma \mid y_{1:T})
\end{align*}
where $p(\phi \mid \sigma,  y_{1:T})$ and $p(\sigma \mid y_{1:T})$ are derived above.</p>

<p>However, if we use the full likelihood (which is what the second part of the question is asking), how can we derive the joint posterior? I do not see any obvious ways to find the appropriate integrating constants. I'm assuming I need to use Gibbs/M-H/or some other kind of MCMC sampling scheme?</p>

<p>Your test statistic is your observed sample value of the <span class=""math-container"">$D_n$</span> random variable, which will be some value, <span class=""math-container"">$d_n$</span> (what you're calling <span class=""math-container"">$D_\text{max}$</span>, but note the usual convention of upper case for random variables and lower case for observed values).

  <p>The phenomenon of pseudo-convergence has led many people to the idea of comparing

  converge to the same distribution, then—according to the multistart heuristic—all is well. 
  But this assumes that you can arrange to have at least one starting point in each part of the 
  state space to which the sampler can pseudo-converge. If you cannot do that—and in the 
  black box situation you never can—then the multistart heuristic is worse than useless: it

57860,5987.0,2,,57852.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>It isn't clear to me whether you're asking what pseudo-convergence is, or whether you're asking how multistart can fail to detect that pseudo-convergence is happening, so I'll try to answer both briefly.  </p>

<p>Imagine that you're using MCMC to sample from a distribution where $X$ has a high probability (say 99.9%) of being uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, and a small probability (say 0.1%) of being uniformly distributed between 1,000,000 and 1,000,001.  This is a black box problem, so in constructing the proposal distribution for the MCMC sampler you might do something naive like considering jumps that are N(0,1) from the current point.  Under these circumstances, if you start at a point in [0,1], then it's virtually impossible that your MCMC sequence will ever reach the isolated interval [1,000,000, 1,000,001].  Your MCMC sampler will then converge very nicely to a U(0,1) distribution.  Conventional convergenece tests will look great, but you'll have converged to an incorrect distribution.  </p>

<p>You might argue that missing that other 0.1% of the distribution really doesn't matter.  Depending on what aspect of the distribution you're interested in, this could be a very serious problem.  For example, if you want to estimate $E[X]$, you'll get 0.5 as your estimate, when it should be around 1,000!</p>

<p>This is an example of false or pseudo convergence.  </p>

<p>Now, suppose you pick a bunch of starting points and run the MCMC sampler from each of those starting points.  As long as each of these starting points is close to [0,1], each MCMC run will eventually converge to a U(0,1) distribution, and you'll be led to believe that $X$ really does have a U(0,1) distribution.  That's the potential danger of relying on the multistart heuristic.</p>

<p>The example that I've used here is admittedly extreme.  However, pseudo convergence is often reported in practice, particularly on problems in which we're sampling in a very high dimensional space and there are lots of isolated regions with reasonably high probability.   </p>

<p>I work with recommender systems on daily basis and have also never heard of the application of such a model as recommender system. I can only speculate about the reasons though.</p>

<p>The main overall reason might be that recommender systems are often applied in a domain where the price/cost of an item is too small to force the customer
to invest time into making a nearly-optimal decision, maximizing his utility. This should be kept in mind in the following section. Such domains
include e-commerce or news portals (where articles are recommended) or sites like tastekid.com, where the decision at this step costs only a click, i.e. virtually nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>

<p>The described conditional multinomial model requires (or works best) with ...</p>

<ul>
<li>characteristics of the customer</li>
<li>characteristics of the items</li>
<li>assumed rationality when it comes to the decision</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's step through every point</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics of the customers</strong></p>

<p>Beside some basic demographic information like gender, address and (may be) age, little is known. The less the price of an item (see above),
the harder it is to request a survey before the selection process starts. Activity data (bought items, ratings etc.) on the other hand can be collected
without any work from the customer and can be used to describe the customer, following the motto ""you are what you are interested in"". The items 
the customer is interested in (the preferences) <em>implicitly capture</em> what is important to the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics of the items</strong></p>

<p>Building a model based on the characteristics of a item is already done, either via ""content based collaborative filtering"" or a model based approach.
These are e.g. used to solve the cold-start-problem, i.e. the fresh new recommender system has not (enough) preferences yet. </p>

<p>The drawback here however is that is hard to automatically collect the properties of an item. Imagine the case of fashion: Some are easy (color, brand),
some are very hard (how does the cloth feels like on skin, how does it look if my hip is broader than average). Sometime it is completely impossible because 
it entirely depends on the reception of the product, e.g. in case of movies. For certain items, such information can be collected by humans or by a very very sophisticated
system understanding semantics and language. It is not clear that the resulting improvement will outweigh the costs. </p>

<p>So instead of saying: ""Item A is similar to item B due to the properties p1,p2,...,"" it is easier to say ""a lot of people have both bought item A and item B. 
I don't know why, but they are similar enough for the purpose of a recommender system"". So the <em>preferences implicitly capture</em> how similar to items are.</p>

<p><strong>Assumed rationality when it comes to the decision</strong></p>

<p>We are humans and we pretend to be rational all the time. If e.g. the price or other circumstances forces us to think hard about it a decision, it might be the 
case that the rational part of a decision is higher than average. But when it comes to utilize advertising to sell people stuff (and yes, recommendations can be
seen as advertising), marketing will tell that rationality plays a lesser role.</p>

<p>Additionally, people are often do not know beforehand which properties are most important to them in order to maximize their personal utility function.
If this would be the case, all buying processes could be described via the usage of a search engine, where 
a) all relevant properties are listed
b) the customer selects all properties relevant to him and name the product of interest
and the search engine delivers exactly the right results.</p>

<p>Instead, people have a basic goal (e.g. buying a suit), but then are browsing around to see how products appeal to them and / or to get inspired.
Making a buy decision is still partially rational (budget, invested time) but often comes down to ""what feels right"". Of course, every domain has its
 own distribution of rationality and emotionality. The more technical, the more facts do play an important role. But
even than the customer might select a brand due to the curtain fire of advertising, which he would not have named as primary criterion beforehand.</p>

<p>So building a economic model here might be still be working and it surely correct, buth might be entirely over the top. Additionally, one might have
to build a separate model for each type of item a shop is selling.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Building a recommender system entirely based on preferences is often done because ...</p>

<ul>
<li>it is simple (=> cheap)</li>
<li>it can be done automatically, no extra work from the customer is required (=> cheap)</li>
<li>it works (good enough), so that a more complicated model might not outweigh the additional costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>But: There are domains, where such a economic model will be better. I do not doubt, that a good estate agent and hence a good expert system based
on a economic model will easily outperform a recommender system based on preferences. I have regularly observed that recommendations made by human experts are often
better than automatic ones. However, the automatics are still good and can produced en mass without too much costs, so that an expert can focus 
on more sophisticated tasks.</p>

versus dependent variable as is common in regression analysis, the
<em>joint</em> distribution of the five random variables $Y_{11}, Y_{12}, Y_{13}, Y_{21},Y_{22}$ is the product of the joint distributions of
$Y_{11}, Y_{12}, Y_{13}$, and $Y_{21},Y_{22}$, both of which are multivariate
normal. This $5$-variate joint distributions
is also a multivariate normal distribution in which the mean vector is
just the concatenation $(\mu_1, \mu_2)^T$ of the two mean vectors and
the covariance matrix is
$$\Sigma = \left[\begin{matrix}\Sigma_{11} &amp; 0\\0 &amp; \Sigma_{22}\end{matrix}\right].$$
Thus, the joint distribution of $Y_{11}-Y_{13}+Y_{22}$ and $Y_{21}-Y_{12}$

Each customer qualifies for the analysis through a qualifying Action ($A$), and has a finite Duration ($D$) to complete Event.  There are a number of interim actions that should have an effect on reaching the Event.  Unlike the time-to-event modeling I've done before, the Duration is known ahead of time, but is different for every customer.  That is, customer 1 may have a duration of 3 months from their qualifying Action; whereas customer 2 may have a duration of 3 weeks.  The duration is always known at the time of the qualifying Action.</p>

<p>Consider an advance car rental booking.  Making the reservation is the qualifying Action.  The Event of interest is whether the customer completes a full online profile.  The Duration is the time period between contract &amp; pickup.  Interim actions might include receiving an email from the agency, calling into a help desk, starting the profile.</p>

<p>I think that incorporating duration is important because a customer booking 1 day in advance might (should) have a different propensity to complete an online profile than one who books 6 months in advance.</p>

<p>My instinct is to transform the duration to a proportion of the finite duration.  Concretely, qualifying Action is time 0 and everyone has a duration of 100.  But I've not seen that actually done in any of my literature review, and it feels like this may lose important information.</p>

<p>Coefficients I get from regression should tell me how many assets I need to buy and sell to get approximately the same payoff as the asset I'm trying to replicate.</p>

<p>There is a problem with regression as the candidate asset matrix is ill-conditioned: assets show high correlation. There's a hope that orthogonal principal components could resolve this problem.</p>

<p>So far I'm doing eigen-decomposition of a <em>covariance matrix</em>, then using eigenvectors to make an orthogonal transformation of the data that is <em>not mean-centered</em>.

$$exp\left\{-\frac{(y-w)^2}{2\sigma_y^2}\right\}\exp\left\{-\frac{(w-\mu_w)^2}{2\sigma_w^2}\right\} =

=\exp\left\{-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2}-\frac{\mu_w^2}{2\sigma_w^2}\right\} \exp\left\{-\frac{w^2}{2\sigma_y^2}-\frac{w^2}{2\sigma_w^2}\right\}\exp\left\{\frac{2yw}{2\sigma_y^2}+\frac{2w\mu_w}{2\sigma_w^2}\right\}$$</p>

<p>Setting $s^2\equiv \sigma_y^2+\sigma_w^2$ we arrive at</p>

<p>$$=\exp\left\{-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2}-\frac{\mu_w^2}{2\sigma_w^2}\right\} \exp\left\{-\frac{s^2}{2\sigma_y^2\sigma_w^2}w^2\right\}\exp\left\{\frac{\sigma_w^2y+\sigma_y^2\mu_w}{\sigma_y^2\sigma_w^2}w\right\}$$</p>

<p>Include the first $\exp$ in the constant, $C^*=C \exp\left\{-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2}-\frac{\mu_w^2}{2\sigma_w^2}\right\}$.
Set
$$\beta\equiv \frac{s^2}{2\sigma_y^2\sigma_w^2},\qquad \alpha\equiv \frac{\sigma_w^2y+\sigma_y^2\mu_w}{\sigma_y^2\sigma_w^2}$$ to obtain</p>

<p>$$f_Y(y) =C^* \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\beta w^2+\alpha w}dw=C^*\left[ \int_{-\infty}^{0}e^{-\beta w^2+\alpha w}dw + \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\beta w^2+\alpha w}dw\right]$$</p>

<p>$$=C^* \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\beta w^2}\left[e^{-\alpha w}+e^{\alpha w}\right]dw =2C^* \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\beta w^2}\operatorname{cosh}(\alpha w)dw$$</p>

<p>where $\operatorname{cosh}$ is the hyperbolic cosine.</p>

<p>Using a formula provided in Gradshteyn &amp; Ryzhik (2007), ""Table of Integrals, Series and Products"", 7th ed., p. 384, eq. 3.546(2) we have</p>

<p>$$f_Y(y)=2C^*\frac 12 \sqrt {\frac {\pi}{\beta}} \exp\left\{\frac {\alpha^2}{4\beta}\right\}$$</p>

<p>Now $$\frac {\alpha^2}{4\beta} = \frac {\left(\frac{\sigma_w^2y+\sigma_y^2\mu_w}{\sigma_y^2\sigma_w^2}\right)^2}{4\frac{s^2}{2\sigma_y^2\sigma_w^2}} = \frac {(\sigma_w^2y+\sigma_y^2\mu_w)^2}{2\sigma_y^2\sigma_w^2s^2}$$ </p>

<p>and bringing back in $C^*$ (and $\beta$) in all its glory we have</p>

<p>$$f_Y(y)=\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma_y\sigma_w}\exp\left\{-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2}-\frac{2\mu_w^2}{\sigma_w^2}\right\}\sqrt{\pi} \left(\sqrt {\frac{s^2}{2\sigma_y^2\sigma_w^2}}\right)^{-1} \exp\left\{\frac {(\sigma_w^2y+\sigma_y^2\mu_w)^2}{2\sigma_y^2\sigma_w^2s^2}\right\} $$</p>

<p>The constant terms simplify to </p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma_y\sigma_w}\sqrt{\pi} \left(\sqrt {\frac{s^2}{2\sigma_y^2\sigma_w^2}}\right)^{-1} = \frac{1}{s\sqrt{2\pi}} $$</p>

<p>and, the exponentials end up in the normal exponential. So in the end</p>

<p>$$f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{s\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{(y-\mu_w)^2}{2s^2}\right\}= N(\mu_w, s^2),\qquad s^2\equiv \sigma_y^2+\sigma_w^2$$</p>

Now plug in $r$ as above in  $a$ from your book, we have: $a=\dfrac{r.S_y}{S_x}=\dfrac{S_{xy}}{(n-1)S_xS_y}.\dfrac{S_y}{S_x}=\dfrac{S_{xy}}{S_x^2(n-1)}$. But from definition of $S_y$ from your book, we can have $S_x=\sqrt{\dfrac{\sum (x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}=\sqrt{\dfrac{S_{xx}}{n-1}}$. Now square both sides and use cross multiplication to have: $S_{xx}=S_x^2.(n-1)$. Now replace this last equality in the denominator of $a$ we found before to get: $a=\dfrac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$. Now work on $a$ from online. Note that $S_{xy}=\sum x_iy_i-\bar{y}\sum x_i-\bar{x}\sum y_i+n\bar{y}\bar{x}=\sum x_iy_i-n\bar{y}\bar{x}$. Hence we have $nS_{xy}=n\sum x_iy_i-n^2\bar{y}\bar{x}=n\sum x_iy_i-\sum x_i \sum y_i.$ So what you have in the numerator of $a$ from online is actually $nS_{xy}$. Now work on the denominator of $a$ and factor out $n$ to get $n\sum x_i^2-(\sum x_i)^2=n\Big(\sum x_i^2-\dfrac{(\sum x_i)^2}{n}\Big )=n\Big(\sum x_i^2-\dfrac{n^2\bar{x}^2}{n}\Big )=n\Big(\sum x_i^2-n\bar{x}^2\Big)=nS_{xx}.$ So what you have in the denominator of $a$ is $nS_{xx}$. Therefore, $a$ from online is actually $a=\dfrac{nS_{xy}}{nSxx}=\dfrac{S_{xy}}{Sxx}$ that is equal to the $a$ from your book. Cheers :)</p>

<p>To see this, first note that your first $a$ formula can written as
$$
a = \frac{r \cdot S_y}{S_x} = \frac{{\rm cov}(y,x) \cdot S_y}{(S_y \cdot S_x) \cdot S_x} = \frac{{\rm cov}(y,x)}{S_x^2},
$$
with ${\rm cov}$ referring to the covariance.</p>

<p>Now if you take the second $a$ formula and assume the variables are centered, then the simple sum terms drop out (because then both variables separately sum to 0). So it just reduces to
$$
a = \frac{\sum x_{i}y_{i}}{\sum x^2_{i}} = \frac{\sum x_{i}y_{i} / (n-1)}{\sum x^2_{i} / (n-1)} = \frac{{\rm cov}(y,x)}{S_x^2},
$$
which matches the first formula. So they coincide if the variables are centered, but not in general. Maybe they mention this assumption in the online article you referred to.</p>

<p>Edit: I suggested that they were not equivalent in general, only in the special case where variables are centered. But @Stat has apparently shown that they are equivalent in general. So I will just leave this answer up in case you find considering this special case to be illuminating :)</p>

<p>It is a repeated measures test. So, a participant is first given an uncolored node-link graph G1 and asked some questions about the graph. The dependent variable is the time it takes for the participant to answer the questions. Next the same participant is given a colored graph G2 and asked a set of questions. This is counterbalanced by reversing the order of the groups. Next I repeat this procedure except that this time, I provide colored G1 and uncolored G2. In all, I have 4 conditions/groups that perform the test in order as specified below:</p>

<ol>
<li>G1-uncolored G2-colored</li>
<li>G2-colored   G1-uncolored</li>
<li>G1-colored   G2-uncolored</li>
<li>G2-uncolored G1-colored</li>
</ol>

<p>I measure the time for each case. The two graphs are almost equal. The only reason I am using two different graphs is because I cannot use the same graph in both the conditions for a group as if I did that, then the participant would remember his answers from the previous condition.</p>

<p>Now, I am not sure what should I call this method? Should I consider one independent variable (i.e. presence/abscence of color in the graph) or whether I consider two different IV (color + which graph is used (G1/G2?)). In other words, is this just a t-dependent test or a two-way ANOVA (dunno which one)?</p>

<p>I have a data of student interactions within a web platform of an online course. The course spans 6 weeks, with new lecture resources and new assignments uploaded at the beginning of each week. The weekly assignments due at the end of each week. Students can watch lecture videos, view/write forum posts, and do assignments. Students can drop out of the course any time (i.e. no longer interacting within the course platform).</p>

<p>Each week, I want to predict the likelihood of a student staying within the course in the next week (<strong>stay in the next week=1, out in the next week=0</strong>). The predictors are the number of times the student watch the lecture videos (<strong>video_views</strong>), the number of posts the student read (<strong>posts_read</strong>), the number of posts the student wrote (<strong>post_written</strong>) and the student's score of this week assignment (<strong>score</strong>).</p>

If you have a multiple regression model with <em>only</em> two explanatory variables then you could try to make a 3D-ish plot that displays the predicted regression plane, but most software don't make this easy to do.  Another possibility is to use a <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20130808154531/http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/2428-when-and-how-to-use-conditional-plots-co-plots-for-data-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coplot</a> (see also: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/14568564/1217536"">coplot in R</a> or <a href=""http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/9780805861853/R/ch07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this pdf</a>), which can represent three or even four variables, but many people don't know how to read them.  Essentially however, if you don't have any interactions, then the predicted <em>marginal</em> relationship between <span class=""math-container"">$x_j$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$y$</span> will be the same as predicted <em>conditional</em> relationship (plus or minus some vertical shift) at any specific level of your other <span class=""math-container"">$x$</span> variables.  Thus, you can simply set all other <span class=""math-container"">$x$</span> variables at their means and find the predicted line <span class=""math-container"">$\hat y = \hat\beta_0 + \cdots + \hat\beta_j x_j + \cdots + \hat\beta_p \bar x_p$</span> and plot that line on a scatterplot of <span class=""math-container"">$(x_j, y)$</span> pairs.  Moreover, you will end up with <span class=""math-container"">$p$</span> such plots, although you might not include some of them if you think they are not important. (For example, it is common to have a multiple regression model with a single variable of interest and some control variables, and only present the first such plot).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you <em>do</em> have interactions, then you should figure out which of the interacting variables you are most interested in and plot the predicted relationship between that variable and the response variable, but with several lines on the same plot.  The other interacting variable is set to different levels for each of those lines.  Typical values would be the mean and <span class=""math-container"">$\pm$</span> 1 SD of the interacting variable.  To make this clearer, imagine you have only two variables, <span class=""math-container"">$x_1$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$x_2$</span>, and you have an interaction between them, and that <span class=""math-container"">$x_1$</span> is the focus of your study, then you might make a single plot with these three lines:<br />
<span class=""math-container"">\begin{align}
\hat y &amp;= \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 x_1 + \hat\beta_2 (\bar x_2 - s_{x_2})  + \hat\beta_3 x_1(\bar x_2 - s_{x_2}) \\

<p>Now, The hashing trick works the same way, though you don't have to initially define the dictionary containing the column position for each word. </p>

<p>In fact it is the hashing function that will give you the range of possible column positions (the hashing function will give you a minimum and maximum value possible) and the exact position of the word you want to encode into the matrix. So for example, let's imagine that the word ""likes"" is hashed by our hashing function into the number 5674, then the column 5674 will contain the encodings relative to the word ""likes"".</p>

<p>In such a fashion you won't need to build a dictionary before analyzing the text. If you will use a sparse matrix as your text matrix you won't even have to define exactly what the matrix size will have to be.

Without knowing the exact joint and marginal distributions, one can still plot the empirical copula of a data set.

<p>Typically, the scaled ranks of a data set (scaled to the interval (0,1)) are a good estimate of a non-parametric inverse of the marginal distributions. An empirical copula's density can then be represented as a scatter plot of the data's scaled ranks. As the spread of (many) points is at times hard to grasp, a smoothed scatter plot provides a visual proxy of the empirical copula's density (see e.g. the function ""smoothScatter"" from the (base) graphics package or ""dependencePlot"" in the package spcopula available from r-forge).

<p>I then found another paper that, aside from suggesting other methods like the Quade test with subsequent Shaffer post-hoc test, they apply the Nemenyi test differently.</p>

<h1>How do I apply the Nemenyi post-hoc test correctly?</h1>

<p><strong>1. Using the Studentized range statistic?</strong></p>

<p>In Demšar's paper it says to reject the null hypothesis (no performance difference of two algorithms) if the average rank difference is greater than the critical distance CD with
<span class=""math-container"">$$
CD = q_{\alpha}\sqrt{{k(k+1)}\over{6N}}
$$</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""where critical values qα are based on the Studentized range statistic divided by <span class=""math-container"">$\sqrt{2}.$</span>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After some digging I've found that you those ""critical values"" can be looked up for certain alphas, for example in a <a href=""http://cse.niaes.affrc.go.jp/miwa/probcalc/s-range/srng_tbl.html#fivepercent"" rel=""noreferrer"">table for <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha = 0.05$</span></a>, for infinite degrees of freedom (at the bottom of each table).</p>

<p><strong>2. or using the normal distribution?</strong></p>

<p>Just when I thought I knew what to do, I found another paper that confused me again, because they were only using the normal distribution. Demšar is stating a similar thing at page 12:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The test statistics for comparing the i-th and j-th classiﬁer using these methods is
  <span class=""math-container"">$$
z = {{(R_i − R_j)}\over{\sqrt{{k(k +1)}\over{6N}}}}
$$</span>
  The z value is used to ﬁnd the corresponding probability from the table of normal distribution, which is then compared with an appropriate <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span>. The tests differ in the way they adjust the value of <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span> to compensate for multiple comparisons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this paragraph he was talking about comparing all algorithms to a control algorithm, but the remark ""differ in the way they adjust ... to compensate for multiple comparisons"" suggests that this should also hold for the Nemenyi test.</p>

<p>So what seems logical to me is to calculate the <em>p</em>-value based on the test statistic <span class=""math-container"">$z$</span>, which is normally distributed, and correct that one by dividing through <span class=""math-container"">$k(k-1)/2$</span>.</p>

<p>However, that yields completely different rank differences at which to reject the null hypothesis. And now I'm stuck and don't know which method to apply. I'm strongly leaning towards the one using the <em>normal distribution</em>, because it is simpler and more logical to me. I also don't need to look up values in tables and I'm not bound to certain significance values.</p>

<p>Then again, I've never worked with the <em>studentized range statistic</em> and I don't understand it.</p>

At the end of the book, the author, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Salsburg"">David Salsburg</a>, proposes three open philosophical problems in statistics, the solutions to which he argues would have larger implications for the application of statistical theory to science.  I had never heard of these problems before, so I am interested in other people's reactions to them.  I am venturing into territory about which I have little knowledge, so I'm just going to describe Salsburg's portrayal of these problems and pose two general questions about these problems below.</p>

<p>Salsburg's philosophical problems are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Can statistical models be used to make decisions?</li>
  <li>What is the meaning of probability when applied to real life?</li>
  <li>Do people really understand probability?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Statistics and decision making</strong></p>

<p>As an illustration of the problem presented in question 1, Salsburg presents the following paradox.  Suppose we organize a lottery with 10000 unnumbered tickets.  If we use probability to make a decision about whether any given ticket will win the lottery by rejecting this hypothesis for tickets with probabilities below, say, .001, we will reject the hypothesis of a winning ticket for all the tickets in the lottery!</p>

<p>Salsburg uses this example to argue that logic is inconsistent with probability theory as probability theory is currently understood, and that, therefore, we currently do not have a good means of integrating statistics (which, in its modern form, is based in large part on probability theory) with a logical means of decision-making.</p>

<p><strong>The meaning of probability</strong></p>

<p>As a mathematical abstraction, Salsburg argues that probability works well, but when we attempt to apply the results to real life, we run into the problem that probability has no concrete meaning in real life.  More specifically, when we say that there is a 95% chance of rain tomorrow, it is unclear to what entities that 95% applies.  Does it apply to the set of possible experiments that we could conduct to obtain knowledge about rain?  Does it apply to the set of people who might go outside and get wet?  Salsburg argues that the lack of a means to interpret probabilities creates problems for any statistical model based on probability (i.e., most of them).</p>

<p><strong>Do people understand probability?</strong></p>

<p>Salsburg argues that one attempt to resolve the issues with the lack of a concrete means of interpreting probability is through the concept of ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_expected_utility"">personal probability</a>"", proposed by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmie_Savage"">Jimmie Savage</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_de_Finetti"">Bruno de Finetti</a>, which understands probability as personal beliefs about the likelihood of future events.  However, in order for personal probability to provide a coherent basis for probability, people need to have a common understanding of what probability is and a common means of using evidence to draw conclusions about probability.  Unfortunately, evidence such as that produce by Kahneman and Tversky suggests that personal beliefs might be a difficult basis on which to create a coherent basis for probability.  Salsburg suggests that statistical methods that model probabilities as beliefs (perhaps such as Bayesian methods? I'm stretching my knowledge here) will need to deal with this problem.</p>

<p><strong>My questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>To what extent are Salsburg's problems really problems for modern statistics?</li>
<li>Have we made any progress towards finding resolutions to these problems?</li>

<p>The pic displays the principal components drawn in the space of the variables. In both computational cases, the PCs are the same - as axes. They orthogonally cross each other in the centre of the cloud. This is because covariance matrix was analyzed (it implies centering). However, the scores (shown as markers on the PC axes) are different. ""Decentered PC1"" = ""Centered PC1"" + 8.04. ""Decentered PC2"" = ""Centered PC2"" + 0.45. It is unclear what use could be of such decentered scores, since they do not share their means with each other and with the data cloud.</p>

Of course we can, the way in which we should go about this is by choosing the course of action that minimises our expected loss.  In this case, all lottery numbers are equally likely to come up; if all provide the same prize, then the expected loss is the same for any number, so it doesn't matter which we choose.  If we also have the option not to play the lottery, that would probably be the course of action we should take as it will minimise our expected loss assuming that the lottery makes a profit for somebody (or at least covers the cost of running the lottery).  Of course this is just common sense and is consistent with logic, and could be expressed in purely probabilistic terms.</p>

<p>No, people do not understand much, least of all probability.</p>

<p>Kahneman and Tversky have shown that human intuition is flawed on many levels, but <em>intuition</em> and <em>understanding</em> are not identical, and I would argue that people understand even less than they intuit.</p>

Most of these X's only have two possible values so they are easy to deal with. However there is an X that has 6 values and an X that has 8 values which I have determined to be fairly important. For now, I am just interested in finding the factors amongst the data that lead a record to be event A. My approach so far has been to calculate all of the probabilities of each individual factor (A, B, C and all X's), calculate the probabilities of all of the X's given factor A, and to then use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of event A given the X. This gives me a feel for which factors seem to be contributing to event A but I am not sure how I should continue my analysis.</p>

<p>I also delved into looking at intersections of events but I feel like that is a big time sink that yields little to no insight because that requires counting all of the intersections and when you want to look at 5+ factors, the amount of counting you have to do is ridiculous (For example, if you want to look at 5 factors, you need to find 2^5 different events because of the possible ways the events can line up. This causes problems especially when I am looking at the factors that have 6 or 8 different possibilities). I wrote some simple java classes to read in a tab delimited text file of the records and to do all of the counting and calculating for me for individual events and some intersections and I also have an excel spreadsheet that I set up first but that seemed to be fairly slow for performing the calculations. Besides adding specific code (or specific formulas in excel) to pick up each individual event, I am not sure how I can efficiently calculate these probabilities. And I'm not sure if calculating these conditional probabilities of the intersections will help me answer the overall question of what are the top 8 factors that contribute to event A.

57955,,2,,57952.0,user31668,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>For normally distributed data, the SE = s, as the mean is an explicit parameter of the normal distribution. In general, standard error arises in Likelihood theory, where you are forming inferences from a likelihood function as opposed to the true sampling distribution. For example, if you are modeling some data as iid Exponential then you would form the likelihood function for your data $L(X|\lambda)= \prod L_{exp}(x_i|\lambda)$, with unknown $\lambda$ and then optimize L(X|$\lambda$) for $\lambda^*$ (i.e, maximum likelihood estimator). The standard error is defined as the curvature of the quadratic approximation to log(L(X|$\lambda^*$))at the MLE, which will equal the standard deviation for normal data. the only difficulty is that for non-normal data, you will need to do a second step to transform the actual parameters of your distribution (e.g., $\lambda$) into an estimate of the sample mean. Here, you would map $\frac{1}{\lambda} \rightarrow\mu$, so the likelihood of the latter equals that of the former, then take the log of that likelihood and get a standard error of that transformed likelihood function. Sorry for the long answer, but its not super clear cut in all cases. Sometime, its even used loosely, so yo need to read the documentation to really know.</p>

<p>Since posting this earlier, we have found an excellent collection of information <a href=""http://bayes.wustl.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. </p>

So there is no doubt in our mind that the Bayesian method <em>trumps</em> the Frequentist one.</p>

<p>However, what we are specifically interested in is the concept of <em>evidence</em> in <em>decibels</em> (it seems that <em>bels</em> or maybe the <em>Jaynes Scale</em> (0,10] analogous to the <em>Richter Scale</em> might have been a more interesting way to consider it).</p>

because the mean of a large sample is likely to be closer to the true

sample, you'll know the value of the mean with a lot of precision
even if the data are very scattered.</p></li>
<li><p>The SD does not change predictably as you acquire more data. The SD
you compute from a sample is the best possible estimate of the SD of
the overall population. As you collect more data, you'll assess the
SD of the population with more precision. But you can't predict
whether the SD from a larger sample will be bigger or smaller than
the SD from a small sample. (This is not strictly true. It is the
variance -- the SD squared -- that doesn't change predictably, but
the change in SD is trivial and much much smaller than the change in
the SEM.)</p></li>

<li>The <strong>Composition method</strong> uses the fact that if $X_1$ has hazard $h_1$, and $X_2$ has hazard $h_2$, then $X=\min(X_1,X_2)$ has hazard  $h=h_1+h_2$. You can represent your piecewise constant hazard as a sum of hazards that are constant on an interval and 0 outside. Generate a value $X_i$ for each interval (it could be $\infty$, since the resulting distributions are not necessarily proper), and take their minimum.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Edit</em> (more detail): with the above notation, the composition hazards are
$$h_1(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} f_1 , &amp; 0\leq t\leq t_1\\ 
                                0, &amp; t &gt; t_1 \end{matrix}\right.$$
$$h_2(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} f_2 , &amp; t_1 &lt; t\leq t_2\\ 
                                0, &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{matrix}\right.$$
$$h_3(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} f_3 , &amp; t_2&lt; t\\ 
                                0, &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{matrix}\right.$$
You can easily calculate the CDF or the cumulative hazard for each of these hazards.</p>

57962,10594.0,1,,,,What's the likelihood function in this case?,<regression><logistic><maximum-likelihood><poisson-distribution><poisson-regression>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I have a data set with a binary response variable as non-zero survival cells (y=0) or zero survival cells (y=1), and I would like to build a model with explanatory variable X. I know that the most straightforward method is to use logistic regression. However, in my case, it is more biologically sound to use a Poisson model. Thus, the number of survived cells follows a Poisson distribution $f(k,\lambda)$, and the response (probability of having zero survival cell) is the Poisson distribution at $k=0$.</p>

<p>Therefore, my model can be written as $y=f(0,\lambda)=e^{-\lambda}$, where $\lambda=g(\beta,x)$. $\lambda$ is a function of $x$ with parameter $\beta$. I am trying to estimate $\beta$ using MLE. </p>

<p>Now I am bit confused about which likelihood function I should use. Shall I assume that $y$ follows a binomial distribution: $y\sim B(1,e^{-\lambda})$, so that I could conduct MLE on the likelihood function from this binomial distribution? What about the Poisson distribution? It is not used in the estimation? Suppose $\beta^{*}$ is the estimated parameter, which gives $\lambda^{*}$. This means that the probability of having zero survival cells follows a $B(1,e^{-\lambda^{*}})$ distribution and the survival cells follows a Poisson $f(k,\lambda^{*})$ distribution?</p>

57964,17573.0,2,,57782.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>You don't seem to want logistic regression at all.  What you say is ""I would like to maximize the difference between true positives and false positives.""  That is a fine objective function, but it is not logistic regression.  Let's see what it is.  </p>

<p>First, some notation.  The dependent variable is going to be $Y_i$:<br>
\begin{align}
Y_i &amp;= \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
               1 \qquad \textrm{Purchase $i$ was profitable}\\
               0 \qquad \textrm{Purchase $i$ was un-profitable}
               \end{array}
       \right.
\end{align}</p>

<p>The independent variables (the stuff you use to try to predict whether you should buy) are going to be $X_i$ (a vector).  The parameter you are trying to estimate is going to be $\beta$ (a vector).  You will predict buy when $X_i\beta&gt;0$.  For observation $i$, you predict buy when $X_i\beta&gt;0$ or when the indicator function $\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0}=1$.</p>

<p>A true positive happens on observation $i$ when both $Y_i=1$ and $\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0}=1$.  A false positive on observation $i$ happens when $Y_i=0$ and $\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0}=1$.  You wish to find the $\beta$ which maximizes true positives minus false positives, or:
\begin{equation}
max_\beta \; \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i\cdot\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0} - \sum_{i=1}^N (1-Y_i)\cdot\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>This is not an especially familiar objective function for estimating a discrete response model, but bear with me while I do a little algebra on the objective function:
\begin{align}
 &amp;\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i\cdot\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0} - \sum_{i=1}^N (1-Y_i)\cdot\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0}\\
= &amp;\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i\cdot\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0} - \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0}
+ \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i\cdot\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0}\\
= &amp;\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i\cdot\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0} - \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0}
+ \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i\cdot\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0} \\
 &amp; \qquad + \sum_{i=1}^N 1 - \sum_{i=1}^N 1 + \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i - \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i\\
= &amp;\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i\cdot\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0} + \sum_{i=1}^N (1-Y_i)(1-\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0}) - \sum_{i=1}^N 1 + \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i \\
\end{align}</p>

<p>OK, now notice that the last two terms in that sum are not functions of $\beta$, so we can ignore them in the maximization.  Finally, we have just shown that the problem you want to solve, ""maximize the difference between true positives and false positives"" is the same as this problem:
\begin{equation}
max_\beta \; \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i\cdot\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0} + \sum_{i=1}^N (1-Y_i)(1-\mathbf{1}_{X_i\beta&gt;0})
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Now, that estimator has a name!  It is named the maximum score estimator.  It is a very intuitive way to estimate the parameter of a discrete response model.  The parameter is chosen so as to maximize the number of correct predictions.  The first term is the number of true positives, and the second term is the number of true negatives.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good way to estimate a (binary) discrete response model.  The estimator is consistent, for example. (Manski, 1985, J of Econometrics)  There are some oddities to this estimator, though.  First, it is not unique in small samples.  Once you have found one $\beta$ which solves the maximization, then any other $\beta$ which makes the exact same predictions in your dataset will solve the maximization---so, infinitely many $\beta$s close to the one you found.  Also, the estimator is not asymptotically normal, and it converges slower than typical maximum likelihood estimators---cube root $N$ instead of root $N$ convergence. (Kim and Pollard, 1990, Ann of Stat)  Finally, you can't use bootstrapping to do inference on it.  (Abrevaya &amp; Huang, 2005, Econometrica)  There are some papers using this estimator though---there is a fun one about predicting results in the NCAA basketball tournament by Caudill, International Journal of Forecasting, April 2003, v. 19, iss. 2, pp. 313-17.</p>

<p>An estimator that overcomes most of these problems is Horowitz's smoothed maximum score estimator (Horowitz, 1992, Econometrica and Horowitz, 2002, J of Econometrics).  It gives a root-$N$ consistent, asymptotically normal, unique estimator which is amenable to bootstrapping.  Horowitz provides example code to implement his estimator on <a href=""http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jlh951/software.html"">his webpage.</a></p>

57969,8869.0,1,,,,A distributional test based on entropy and self-information,<entropy>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Say that I have a real-valued discrete distribution $p(x)$ and $N$ samples, $x_1, \ldots, x_N$, and I want to test whether the samples came from the distribution without making any further assumptions whatsoever. Note that there are very few samples; in the application that motivated me to make this post, we have $N = 5$. Thus Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Chi-squared tests are not expected to have much power.</p>

<p>I had a simple idea for doing this under the assumption that one can efficiently sample from $p(x)$. Being a bit statistically naive, I'm having difficulty figuring out whether it exists in the literature or not, and hoping someone can point me to the right resource.</p>

<p>The idea in a nutshell is to compare the self-information of the sample, $\hat{I}_N$, to the distribution of the self-information $I_N$ of $N$ random samples from $p(x)$. Formally, recall that the self-information of a random variable $X$ having distribution $p$ is given by </p>

<p>$$ I = - \log p(X), $$</p>

<p>and the self-information of $N$ iid random variables $X_1,\ldots X_N$ each having distribution $p(x)$ is given by</p>

<p>$$ I_N = -\sum_{i=1}^N \log p(X_k). $$</p>

<p>The self-information of the sample data we have, $x_1,\ldots,x_N$ is denoted</p>

<p>$$ \hat{I}_N = -\sum_{k=1}^N \log p(x_k). $$</p>

<p>As a test statistic one might consider $\hat{C} = C(\hat{I}_N)$, where $C(s) = \mathbb{P}(I_N &lt; s)$ is the cumulative distribution function. If $\hat{C}$ takes a value very close to 0 or 1, then it has an extreme value compared to the distribution of $I_N$, and is unlikely to come from $p(x)$. For concreteness, we could use the standard thresholds for extreme value tests, such as 0.95 and 0.05 for the high and low ends respectively.</p>

<p>As an example application of this test, say that $p(x)$ is some strange multimodal distribution with multiple humps, and the samples $x_1,\ldots,x_N$ lie in the valleys between the humps. It is not clear that there is any test suitable from the literature for such a problem, but intuitively we can see that the samples are unlikely to have come from $p(x)$ because the values of $p(x_i)$ are so small, or equivalently, the self-information $-\log p(x_i)$ is much larger than typical. In terms of the above discussion, $\hat{C}$ will be very close to 1, and the hypothesis will be rejected. </p>

<p>The main problem I see with this test is that the distribution of $I_N$ may be difficult to compute. That may be, but in many cases I would imagine that a few million (or billion) Monte Carlo samples would suffice to get a good approximation of the distribution. Analytical/asymptotic approximations could be used to speed things up, get theoretical results, etc. For example, the first moment of $I_N$ is $N$ times the Shannon entropy, and higher moments could be computed without great difficulty.</p>

<p>For motivation, I could do Gibbs sampling if the distributions $f(\mathbf x\mid y)$  and $f(y \mid \mathbf x)$ were both easy to simulate from by initializing $(\mathbf X_0, Y_0)$ and drawing $\mathbf X_t \sim f(x \mid Y_{t-1})$ and $Y_t \sim f(y \mid \mathbf X_t)$. If $f(\mathbf x \mid y)$ is easy to sample from, then I am in really good shape because, worst case scenario, I can replace $f(y \mid \mathbf x)$ with any update that leaves this distribution invariant. </p>

<p>In my situation, $f(\mathbf x \mid y)$ is difficult to sample from, and substantial work would have to go into constructing a suitable transition kernel given the dimension of $\mathbf x$. However, I can draw from the marginal $f(\mathbf x)$ exactly! It seems like this should buy me something like it does with the Gibbs sampler, however if I do something like the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Draw $\mathbf X_t \sim f(\mathbf x)$;</li>
<li>Draw $Y_t \sim K(y \mid \mathbf X_t, Y_{t-1})$ where $K(\cdot \mid \mathbf x, y)$ leaves $f(y \mid \mathbf x)$ invariant,</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe I will not get the correct stationary distribution. </p>

<p>If it helps, I might be willing to evaluate the density $f(y \mid \mathbf x)$. I know $f(y \mid \mathbf x)$ up-to a normalizing constant, but I can afford to do one numerical integration to get the constant (I would really prefer not to, though). However, $f(y \mid \mathbf x)$ is expensive to compute.</p>

<p>One thought I've had is to generate $f(\mathbf x)$ and then do a small number of MH random walk steps, but I would very much prefer getting an answer that will at least converge to the correct thing as $t \to \infty$ (this one will always have some error if I do a small number of steps for each $Y_t$). </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Maybe this all seems obvious - just use generic sampling techniques for each $f(y \mid \mathbf x)$ and, in general, I shouldn't be able to do better. I guess what I have in mind is that I should somehow be able to get the MCMC to work across $t$, and <em>not</em> have to do my approximate sampling within $t$. That is, I want my approximation to get better and better as $t \to \infty$; I don't want my approximation to have the same amount of error within $t$. </p>

<p>In general, though, $f(y \mid \mathbf x)$ might be very different for different values of $\mathbf x$ so I shouldn't hope for a solution that will always work. I just want something that has a good chance of working and addresses the above issues. It is strange to me that $f(\mathbf x)$ would be less useful than $f(\mathbf x \mid y)$. </p>

57986,5045.0,1,,,,Constructing the OLS standard error by hand to avoid regression,<regression><variance><standard-error><treatment-effect>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I am having trouble deriving the standard error of a simple regression estimator by hand. Stata code and output for a toy example using the cars dataset is below.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that I have a binary treatment that interacts with a binary covariate. All observations are independent. I'm probably overlooking something simple.</p>

<p>My outcome is a weighted average of the effects in the two groups:
\begin{equation}
TE= \frac{N_1 \cdot \delta_1 + N_2 \cdot \delta_2}{N_1+N_2}=\frac{N_1 \cdot (\bar X_{T_1}-\bar X_{C_1}) + N_2 \cdot (\bar X_{T_2}-\bar X_{C_2})}{N_1+N_2},
\end{equation}
where $N_i=T_i+C_i$ is the number of people in group $i$ and $\delta_i$ is the effect of treatment in group $i$. I will estimate the $\delta$s with the group-specific difference in sample means. My manual calculation agrees with the regression output below.</p>

<p>Using the standard sum of weighed random variables, I get
\begin{equation}
Var[TE]= \left(\frac{N_1}{N_1+N_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left[ \frac{\sigma^2_{T_1}}{N_{T_1}}+\frac{\sigma^2_{C_1}}{N_{C_1}}\right]
+\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1+N_2}\right)^2 \cdot\left[ \frac{\sigma^2_{T_2}}{N_{T_2}}+\frac{\sigma^2_{C_2}}{N_{C_2}}\right],
\end{equation}</p>

<p>This is the quantity that I am having trouble scaling to get the standard error. My intuition is that the delta method used by Stata is using the covariance terms, whereas I am dropping them by assumption. <strong>Is there a way to get the OLS standard error without using OLS?</strong> I am trying to avoid running a regression.</p>

<p>If it is the case of randomly scattered infinitely small water droplets in a continuous 2-D field, then probability of water in the hoop would be $p_w \approx 1$ for all sizes of hoop. </p>

<p>Why? We can imagine the hoop consisting of N number of equally sized 'pockets'. Probability of water found in hoop = $P(\text{water found any of N pockets}) = 1-(P(\text{water not found in a single pocket}))^N$</p>

<p>As long as size of pocket $\ne 0$, $P(\text{water not found in a single pocket}) =1-p \ne 1$ and thus $(P(\text{water not found in a single pocket}))^N \approx 0$ as $N \to \infty$.</p>

57995,594.0,2,,57992.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>If you want the <em>distribution</em> on the range min to max and with a given population mean:</p>

<p>One common solution when trying to generate a distribution with specified mean and endpoints is to use a location-scale family beta distribution.</p>

<p>The usual <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">beta</a> is on the range 0-1 and has two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The mean of that distribution is $\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}$. If you multiply by $\text{max}-\text{min}$ and add $\text{min}$, you have something between $\text{max}$ and $\text{min}$ with mean $\text{min}+\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}(\text{max}-\text{min})$.</p>

<p>This suggests you should take</p>

<p>$\beta/\alpha = \frac{\text{max} - \text{mean}}{\text{mean}-\text{min}}$</p>

<p>Or </p>

<p>$\alpha/\beta = \frac{\text{mean} - \text{min}}{\text{max}-\text{mean}}$</p>

<p>This leaves you with a free parameter (you can choose $\alpha$ or $\beta$ freely and the other is determined). You could choose the smaller of them to be ""1"". Or you could choose it to satisfy some other condition, if you have one (such as a specified standard deviation). Larger $\alpha$ and $\beta$ will look more 'bell-shaped'.</p>

<p>In Minitab, <code>Calc</code> $\to$ <code>Random Data</code> $\to$ <code>Beta</code>.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could generate from a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">triangular distribution</a> rather than a beta distribution. (Or any number of other choices!)</p>

<p>The triangular distribution is usually defined in terms of its min, max and mode, and its mean is the average of the min, max and mode. The triangular distribution is reasonably easy to generate from even if you don't have specialized routines for it.  To get the mode from a given mean, use mode = 3$\,\times\,$mean - min - max. However, the mean is restricted to lie in the middle third of the range (which is easy to see from the fact that the mean is the average of the mode and the two endpoints).</p>

<p>Below is a plot of the density functions for a beta (specifically, $\text{beta}(2,3)$) and a triangular distribution, both with mean 40% of the way between the min and the max:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MG4vx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p>One the other hand, if you want the <em>sample</em> to have a smallest value of min and a largest value of max and a given sample mean, that's quite a different exercise. There are easy ways to do that, though some of them may look a bit odd.</p>

<p>One simple method is as follows. Let $p=\frac{\text{mean} - \text{min}}{\text{max}-\text{min}}$. Place $b=\lfloor p(n-1)\rfloor$ points at 1, and $n-1-b$ points at 0, giving an average of $b/(n-1)$ and a sum of $b$. To get the right average, we need the sum to be $np$, so we place the remaining point at $np-b$, and then multiply all the observations by ${\text{max}-\text{min}}$ and add $\text{min}$.</p>

<p>e.g. consider $n$ = 12, min = 10, max = 60, mean = 30, so $p$ = 0.4, and $b$ = 4. With seven (12-1-4) points at 0 and four at 1, the sum is 4. If we place the remaining point at 12$\,\times\,$0.4$\,$-$\,$4 = 0.8, the average is 0.4 ($p$). We then multiply all the values by ${\text{max}-\text{min}}$ (50) and add $\text{min}$ (10) giving a mean of 30. Then randomly sample the whole set of $n$ without replacement, (or equivalently, just randomly order them). You now have a random sample with the required mean and extremes, albeit one from a discrete distribution.</p>

$$ Y = b0 - b1 * X1 + b2 * X2  $$</p>

The F-statistics calculated is supposed to tell me if adding the second variable is significant (more details in that link).</p>

<p>$$ F= {\frac{(R_L^2 - R_S^2)/(k_L-k_s)}{(1-R_L^2)/(N-k_L-1)}}$$</p>

<p>My first variable has a strong correlation:
regression_coeff_string:    b1 =      0.664, b0 =      0.035
R2_val: 0.564</p>

<p>My second variable has a weak correlation:
regression_coeff_string:    b1 =    -25.026, b0 =      0.469, 
R2_val: 0.027</p>

<p>Adding my seond variable only marginally improves the R2 value
regression_coeff_string:    b0 =     0.0559, b1 =     0.6633, b2 =    -5.2222, 
R2_val: 0.565</p>

<p>However, because I have a sample size 2949, that
With $$ R_L^2 = 0.565, R_S^2 = 0.564$$
$k_L$ the number of predictors in the full set being 2, 
$k_S$ the number of predictors in the subset being 1
$$ F= {\frac{(0.565 - 0.564)/(2-1)}{(1-0.565)/(2949-2-1)}} = 6.77$$</p>

<p>With F(1,2946) at 0.05 confidence having a F_stat of 4.182, the result is significant.  But it seems that it is only because the sample size is large.  If I sort the second variable X2 in ascending order in Excel and leave the order of the Y and X1 variables unchanged, I would still get a significant F score.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can I do a fair incremental R2 test for the addition of a new variable in multiple regression when the sample size becomes large?  </p>

<p>Simply looking at the R2 of each X variable individually does not take into account that that they may be cross-correlated, that is why I turned to the incremental R2 test to see how the overall R2 improves relative to adding a new variable.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT1:</strong></p>

<p>The context of my example is predicting solar radiation.  The first variable is a solar radiation variable from NWP (numerical weather prediction) software (ie. high correlation).  The other variables are other NWP output variables and we are trying to improve our prediction.  </p>

<p>If they are independent, i.e. $p(x|y) = p(x)$, the $p(x)$ is constant with respect to $y$. Be careful here, as you don't specify what you are maximising with respect to - from what you wrote earlier, I would assume you are maximising with respect to $y$.</p>

<p>Introducing $\theta$ makes this an entirely new problem. In general, the answer to most of this question here seems to be 'it depends'. We could denote parameters as $y$ if we wanted, and maximise with respect to them.

Now given $r_{t-j},j=1,2,...$, you know the values of $\sigma_{t|t-1}$ because $\sigma^2_{t|t-1}=\omega+\alpha r_{t-1}^2$. So you can take it out of expectation to have: $E(r_t^2|r_{t-j},j=1,2,...)=\sigma^2_{t|t-1}E(\epsilon_t^2|r_{t-j},j=1,2,...)$. Also $\epsilon_t$ is independent of $r_{t-j},j=1,2,...$, so (roughly speaking) any function of that is also independent of $r_{t-j},j=1,2,...$. In particular, $f(x)=x^2$. So, $\epsilon_t^2$ is independent of $r_{t-j},j=1,2,...$. Hence, $E(r_t^2|r_{t-j},j=1,2,...)=\sigma^2_{t|t-1}E(\epsilon_t^2)$. Finally note that $\epsilon_t\sim N(0,1)$.

Therefore, $E(r_t^2|r_{t-j},j=1,2,...)=\sigma^2_{t|t-1}.$ Now we can change $t$ to $t+h$ to get $h$-step ahead forecasts, i.e. $E(r_{t+h}^2|r_{t-j},j=1,2,...)=\sigma^2_{t+h|t-1}.$ I think you can now answer your 2nd question.

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Thanks for replies</p>

<p>After taking some great courses, I'd like to add some points:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is measure of information, i.e., $x^T\Sigma^{-1}x$ is amount of info along the direction $x$.</li>
<li><strong>Duality:</strong> Since $\Sigma$ is positive definite, so is $\Sigma^{-1}$, so they are dot-product norms, more precisely they are dual norms of each other, so we can derive Fenchel dual for the regularized least squares problem, and do maximization w.r.t dual problem. We can choose either of them, depending on their conditioning.</li>
<li><strong>Hilbert space:</strong> Columns (and rows) of $\Sigma^{-1}$ and $\Sigma$ span the same space. So there is not any advantage (other that when one of these matrices is ill-conditioned) between representation with $\Sigma^{-1}$ or $\Sigma$</li>
<li><strong>Bayesian Statistics:</strong> norm of $\Sigma^{-1}$ plays an important role in the Bayesian statistics. I.e. it determined how much information we have in prior, e.g., when covariance of the prior density is like $\|\Sigma^{-1}\|\rightarrow 0 $  we have non-informative (or probably Jeffreys prior)</li>
<li><strong>Frequentist Statistics:</strong> It is closely related to Fisher information, using the Cramér–Rao bound. In fact, fisher information matrix (outer product of gradient of log-likelihood with itself) is Cramér–Rao bound it, i.e. $\Sigma^{-1}\preceq \mathcal{F}$ (w.r.t positive semi-definite cone, i.e. w.r.t. concentration ellipsoids). So when $\Sigma^{-1}=\mathcal{F}$ the maximum likelihood estimator is efficient, i.e. maximum information exist in the data, so frequentist regime is optimal. In simpler words, for some likelihood functions (note that functional form of the likelihood purely depend on the probablistic model which supposedly generated data, aka generative model), maximum likelihood is efficient and consistent estimator, rules like a boss. (sorry for overkilling it)</li>

<p>Generally, for probability distributions you have:</p>

and
V
$$
V(X+Y) = V(X)+V(Y) + 2\text{Cov}(X,Y)

with E and V being the expectation and variance respectively ($SD = \sqrt{V}$).   </p>

<p>For you, this means the mean of the sum is just the sums of the means (so you can get it). For the SD of the sum you also need the covariance or correlation between the FM and FFM. One might use sensible guesses to get realistic lower and upper bounds. Your question regarding FM/(FM+FFM) is much more complicated. </p>

<p>I am not even sure that it is possible without knowing the exact distributions. There is an approximate solution using the delta method:

Consider a prior with near zero variance: you're basically saying ""before looking at the data, I'm almost positive I already know the location of the true value of the statistic."" Conversely, if you set a really wide variance, you're saying ""without looking at the data, I have really no assumptions about the true value of the parameter.

58012,17573.0,2,,57924.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>First, the incidental parameter problem is pretty easy to solve in a discrete duration model.  As long as you are willing to assume a logistic form for your model, you can eliminate the incidental parameters via a clever conditioning argument.  The usual cite in economics is Chamberlain (1980, Rev Econ Stud).  If you prefer a textbook, there is Greene's <em>Econometric Analysis</em> (any of the recent editions) --- look up ""fixed effects model binary choice"" or ""Chamberlain"" in the index.  In the seventh edition, the discussion runs from pg 721 through 725.   The resulting estimator is usually called ""fixed-effects logit"" or ""Chamberlain's estimator.""  </p>

<p>To be clear, you DO NOT just run a logistic regression with a bunch of dummy variables for households.  If you are a <a href=""http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?xtlogit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stata</a> user, the <code>xtlogit</code> command with the <code>fe</code> option runs Chamberlain's fixed effects logit model.  In R, I don't know how to do it.  There are a couple of questions on this here at cross validated (<a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2134/r-package-for-fixed-effect-logistic-regression"">one</a>, <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/10141/discrete-choice-panel-models-in-r?lq=1"">two</a>), and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2804001/panel-data-with-binary-dependent-variable-in-r"">one</a> over at stack overflow.  The answers  in those threads seem mostly to misunderstand what the Chamberlain estimator is, and I think the right conclusion from them is that Chamberlain's estimator is not currently implemented in R. (I would love to be corrected if I am wrong)</p>

<p>Looking over your question again, I wonder whether you really want a fixed effects estimator.  As with any fixed effects estimator, you are not going to be able to directly estimate the effects of any household characteristic which does not change over time.  Generally, schooling, occupation, household size are fixed or almost fixed in a short panel.  If you include time dummies (and why wouldn't you?), then any characteristic which changes regularly with time within each household cannot be included.  Age, for example, since, once you control for time, it is just birth date, a fixed characteristic of household head.  Similarly, even the effect of the duration of the unemployment spell cannot be measured once you have time dummies and household dummies, unless some households have multiple unemployment spells.</p>

<p>Documentation/research on proc ucm is sparse. There are two questions I'm trying to find answers for:
a. Does the dependent variable have to be treated for weak stationarity (differenced) before running proc UCM?
Ans. <a href=""http://www.iasri.res.in/sscnars/socialsci/17-Structural%20Time%20Series%20Models%20for%20Describing%20Trend%20in%20All%20India%20Sunflower%20Yield%20Using%20SAS.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iasri.res.in/sscnars/socialsci/17-Structural%20Time%20Series%20Models%20for%20Describing%20Trend%20in%20All%20India%20Sunflower%20Yield%20Using%20SAS.pdf</a></p>

<p>The attached paper seems to suggest that I don't need to worry about stationarity while using proc ucm. </p>

<p>However, I have found a contrary situation in my data. Consider my dependent is y. And, t &amp; s are the smoothed trend &amp; season components isolated by proc ucm. I'd have expected the series (y-t-s) to be stationary. But, it was not.</p>

<p>Thereby, I conclude that proc ucm is not capable of handling non-stationary time series, until I explicitly difference/stationarize the dependent.</p>

<p>Is this right?</p>

<p>b. I also have regressors which exhibit co-integrated relationships with y. From Granger's research paper, it is evident that spurious regression results when co-integrated series exists. But, I hear that's only if we use OLS-based proc reg. Proc UCM is based on maximum likelihood estimation. Is co-integration not a problem with maximum likelihood estimation based regression? </p>

58026,8958.0,2,,57156.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I doubt that unsupervised will work better but it could be a cool exercise to try out. Unsupervised learning with random forest is done by constructing a joint distribution based on your independent variables that roughly describes your data. Then simulate a certain number of observations using this distribution. For example if you have 1000 observations you could simulate 1000 more. Then you label them, e.g. 1:= real observation, 0:=simulated observation. After this, you run a usual random forest classifier trying to distinguish the real observations from the simulated ones. Note that you must have the calculate the proximity option turned on. The real useful output is exactly this, a description of proximity between your observations based on what Random Forest does when trying to assign these labels. You now have a description of how ""close"" or ""similar"" your observations are from each other and you could even cluster them based on many techniques. A straightforward one would be to select thresholds for these ""distances"". I mean stick together observations that are closer than a certain threshold. Another easy option is to do hierarchical clustering but using this particular distance matrix. If you can work with R, most hierarchical clustering packages allow you to feed the functions custom distance matrices. You then select a cutoff point, you may visualize it as a dendrogram and so on and so forth. </p>

58014,16043.0,2,,57990.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think the core misunderstanding stems from questions you ask in the first half of your question. I approach this answer as contrasting MLE and Bayesian inferential paradigms. A very approachable discussion of MLE can be found in chapter 1 of Gary King, <em>Unifying Political Methodology.</em> Gelman's <em>Bayesian Data Analysis</em> can provide details on the Bayesian side.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Bayes' theorem, $$p(y|x)=\frac{p(x|y)p(y)}{p(x)}$$
   and from the book I'm reading, $p(x|y)$ is called the likelihood, but I assume it's just the conditional probability of $x$ given $y$, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The likelihood <em>is</em> a conditional probability. To a Bayesian, this formula describes the distribution of the parameter $y$ given data $x$ and prior $p(y)$. But since this notation doesn't reflect your intention, <strong>henceforth I will use ($\theta$,$y$) for parameters and $x$ for your data.</strong></p>

<p>But your update indicates that $x$ are observed from some distribution $p(x|\theta,y)$. If we place our data and parameters in the appropriate places in Bayes' rule, we find that these additional parameters pose no problems for Bayesians:
$$p(\theta|x,y)=\frac{p(x,y|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(x,y)}$$</p>

<p>I believe this expression is what you are after in your update.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The maximum likelihood estimation tries to maximize $p(x,y|\theta)$, right? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. MLE posits that $$p(x,y|\theta) \propto p(\theta|x,y)$$
That is, it treats the term $\frac{p(\theta,y)}{p(x)}$ as an unknown (and unknowable) constant. By contrast, Bayesian inference treats $p(x)$ as a normalizing constant (so that probabilities sum/integrate to unity) and $p(\theta,y)$ as a key piece of information: the prior. We can think of $p(\theta,y)$ as a way of incurring a penalty on the optimization procedure for ""wandering too far away"" from the region we think is most plausible. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If so, I'm badly confused, because $x,y,\theta$ are random variables, right? To maximize $p(x,y|\theta)$ is just to find out the $\hat{\theta}$? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In MLE, $\hat{\theta}$ is assumed to be a <em>fixed</em> quantity that is unknown but able to be inferred, <em>not</em> a random variable. Bayesian inference treats $\theta$ as a random variable. Bayesian inference puts probability density functions <em>in</em> and gets probability density functions <em>out</em>, rather than point summaries of the model, as in MLE. That is, Bayesian inference looks at the full range of parameter values and the probability of each. MLE posits that $\hat{\theta}$ is an adequate summary of the data given the model.</p>

58018,668.0,2,,57972.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>This question comes up in analyses of spatial relationships, especially in studying edge effects in spatial statistics.  <strong>The answer depends intimately on the shape of the field, the shape of the water within the field, and the size of the hoop.</strong></p>

<p>A hoop of radius $r$ ""contains water"" if and only if its center lies within distance $r$ of water, which we may view as a point set $W$ in the plane.  To solve this, construct the $r$ <em>buffer</em> of the water: this is the locus of all points within distance $r$ of water.  Let's call it $B_r(W).$</p>

<p>Assume now that the field $F$ is also modeled as a set of points in the plane, and suppose it is <em>bounded</em> and <em>measurable.</em>  Regardless of the shape of $W$ (it might not be measurable), this implies (via standard compactness arguments) that $B_r(W) \cap F$ is (Borel) measurable for all positive buffer distances $r$.  Accordingly, it is meaningful to talk about the probability that a uniformly distributed hoop center lies within $B_r(W) \cap F$.  By the very definition of a uniform distribution, <strong>that probability is precisely the buffer area divided by the area of the field.</strong></p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hggr2.png"" alt=""Figure""></p>

<ol>
<li><p>(A single puddle, at left.)  The field is a circle of diameter $R$ and the water is represented by a single interior point of distance at least $r$ from the boundary of the field.  The buffer $B_r(W)$ then is a circle of radius $r$ and its area relative to that of the field is $(r/R)^2$.</p></li>
<li><p>(Multiple puddles, center.)  As before, but now the water is a finite set of $n$ points all separated by at least $2r$ from each other and all lying at least $r$ from the field's boundary.  The probability is now $n(r/R)^2.$</p></li>
<li><p>(Circular pond, at right.)  Suppose the water is a circular pond of radius $w$ and, as before, lies no closer than $r$ to the field's boundary.  Its buffer is a circle of radius $w+r,$ whence the probability is $\left((w+r)/R\right)^2.$</p></li>
<li><p>(Canal system.) Let the field be a rectangle and suppose the water forms a gridded irrigation system covering the field.  The spacing between the edge of one irrigation canal and the edge of the next is no greater than $2r$.  The buffer $B_r(W)$ now covers the entire field (by design!) and the probability is $1$.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v6xWS.png"" width=""300"" height=""300""></p>

<p><em>This figure (taken from an answer at <a href=""https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/17390"">https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/17390</a>) shows a small-radius buffer of an irregular set of line segments (the irrigation ditches, shown in black) within a rectangular field.  As the radius grows, eventually the buffer--the gray area--will merge into the entirety of the field.  (The pink areas are not relevant to the present discussion.)</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that in many of these cases the water may have practically no area--it would be represented on a map as a collection of points or line segments--while the probability could end up being anything between $0$ and $1$.  When the water forms a connected, simply-connected domain that is not too tortuous and the buffer distance $r$ is very small (smaller than the width of the water at its narrowest point), then the buffer area is approximately </p>

<p>$$|W| + rP + \pi r^2$$</p>

<p>where $|W|$ is the area of the water and $P$ is the length of the <em>perimeter</em> of the water (assuming it is finite).  (This formula is exact for piecewise linear convex domains: that is, convex <em>polygons</em>.)  To first order in $r,$ then, the probability is approximately</p>

<p>$$\frac{|W| + rP}{|F|}$$</p>

<p>where $|F|$ is the area of the field.  This shows that <strong>initially, for very small $r$, the probability grows linearly with $r$ and the slope (constant of proportionality) is the ratio of the perimeter of $W$ to the area of the field, $P/|F|.$</strong></p>

I have a computer vision background, so I'm mostly familiar with 2D MRFs/CRFs for image restoration and segmentation. </p>

In CRFs you have an edge to each pixel y in the image. I can fully understand that CRFs are trained in a discriminative way and thus they are tractable and that it wouldn't be possible to really learn a generative model based on such a CRF graph. However in all the literature it seems that by definition the MRF model cannot have edges from a x_i to all pixels y, as it then would no longer be a MRF.

You can think of them both as their own curve with known error on each point. They look quite similar, and if I calculate the R2 value it comes out to >0.9. But what I want to be able to calculate is a P value comparing these two curves (i.e., what is the probability that the difference i'm looking at is just due to noise?). Now I could easily do a student t-test at each point and come up with a P-value at each point, sure. But is there some way to come up with an over-all P value that uses all the points and not just one? Thanks very much for any help.</p>

Skew indicates how asymmetrical the distribution is, with more skew indicating that one of the tails ""stretches"" out from the mode farther than the other does.</p>

<p>Practically: High kurtosis indicates a high propensity of a distribution to give you ""outliers"", in the sense that you will tend to get a lot of rather closely spaced outcomes, followed by a few, rare, way-out-there values. In the markets, this type of distribution can lull you into a sense of complacency, with well localized values most of the time, only to ruin your day with a crazy loss. For skewed distributions, a right-skew to a financial product indicates that its positive returns tend to be higher than its losses, for a simple example, which all other things being equal, is good.</p>

58036,22399.0,2,,58031.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Consider your two types situation (say Gender to be concrete). Suppose, that you decide to code as follows:</p>

<p>If respondent is male: Set M = 1 or 0 otherwise</p>

<p>If respondent is female: Set F = 1 or 0 otherwise</p>

<p>Then the data set will look like so:</p>

<pre><code>M F Y
1 0 y1
0 1 y2
1 0 y3
1 0 y4
0 1 y5
0 1 y6
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, including both these variables as part of your $x$ matrix would lead to a singular design matrix which cannot be inverted. In other words, you cannot estimate the effect of both 'male' and 'female' respondents on your dependent variable independently of each other. Thus, you decide to drop one of these variables (say 'F'). Then assuming a model that looks like so:</p>

<p>$y=a + b M $</p>

<p>the OLS estimate of the intercept will give us effect of the average 'male' respondent on $y$ and $a+b$ the effect of the 'female' respondent. In other words, $b$ gives us the difference between female and male respondents on $y$.</p>

<p>What happens if we code M as $1, -1$?</p>

<p>Then the equation for male respondents and female respondents are:</p>

<p>$y_m = a + b$ and</p>

<p>$y_f = a - b$</p>

<p>Thus, $b$ is now $\frac{y_m-y_f}{2}$ which is bit complex to interpret. Thus, a simpler way to obtain interpretability is to choose a coding scheme such as: $0.5, -0.5$ instead of $1, -1$ which then results in:</p>

<p>$y_m = a + 0.5 b$ and</p>

<p>$y_f = a - 0.5 b$</p>

<p>Thus, $b$ is $y_m-y_f$ which is identical to the interpretation we obtained when we chose to code them as $1, 0$.</p>

<p>The above logic can be extended to the context of more than two categorical variables. If you want to know more you should probably look up 'Contrast Coding' as the different ways to code categorical variables are different ways to estimate contrasts between the categorical variables (e.g., do we want to estimate the impact of male - female in which case we pick the 'M' column or do we want to estimate the impact of female - male in which we case we pick the 'F' column).</p>

In essence, the K-S test looks for sufficient evidence that the true distribution, $F$, is different from your assumed distribution $F_0$ by looking at the maximum absolute deviation $K = \sup_x \hat F(x) - F_0(x)$. But first we must note two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your ""reliability"" functions here are also called <em>survival</em> functions, often denoted $\bar F$, and defined as $$\bar F(x) = 1 - F(x)$$ where $F$ is the cdf. So it is easily seen that $$K = \sup_x \hat F(x) - F_0(x) = \sup_x \hat {\bar F}(x) - \bar F_0(x).$$</p></li>

</ol>

<p>As for interpretation of your plot, I think you need to recognize the following: the <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power"" rel=""nofollow"">power</a></em> of the K-S test is very low at this sample size. Power of course is the probability of rejecting the null when the null is not true. You'll notice that, for example, at $t=4$, you would have to have <em>over 30% failure</em> in order to reject your distribution assumption, a far cry from the 5% the client wanted.</p>

<p>How to remedy this? That's the tough question for professional statisticians. My thought is that the reason the K-S test has such low power is that it is so <em>general</em>. Do you really need the Weibull fit? How about setting up tests for both 4-year and 8-year marks, and adjusting your level according to the fact that you have two tests. In fact, since these would be binary results (failed vs. didn't fail), you can possibly use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test"" rel=""nofollow"">Fisher's Exact Test</a> to obtain both the level <em>and</em> the power of your test.

the random variable X.

\sigma^2 &amp;= \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i-\bar{y})^2\\

\end{align}$$
Applying $(1)$ to the given set of $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$
which we take for convenience in exposition to have mean $\bar{x} = 0$,
we have that
$$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_i^2-(\bar{x})^2\right)
= \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$$
If we now add in a new observation $x_{n+1}$ to this data set, then the new mean of
the data set is 
$$\frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}x_i 
= \frac{n\bar{x} + x_{n+1}}{n+1} = \frac{x_{n+1}}{n+1}$$ 
while the new variance is
$$\begin{align}
\hat{\sigma}^2 &amp;= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \left(x_i^2-\frac{x_{n+1}^2}{(n+1)^2}\right)\\ 
&amp;= \frac{1}{n}\left[\left((n-1)\sigma^2 + x_{n+1}^2\right)

&amp;= \left.\left.\frac{1}{n}\right[(n-1)\sigma^2 + \frac{n}{n+1}x_{n+1}^2\right]\\
&amp;&gt; \sigma^2 ~ \text{only if}~ x_{n+1}^2 &gt; \frac{n+1}{n}\sigma^2.

So $|x_{n+1}|$ needs to be larger than $\displaystyle\sigma\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}$
or, more generally, $x_{n+1}$ needs to
differ from the mean $\bar{x}$ of the original data
set by more than $\displaystyle\sigma\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}$, in order for
the augmented data set to have larger variance than the original data set.
See also Ray Koopman's answer which points out that the new variance is larger
than, equal to, or smaller than, the original variance according as $x_{n+1}$
differs from the mean by more than, exactly, or less than $\displaystyle\sigma\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}$.</p>

$$
f(y)  = \ln \Bigl(\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}y^k(1-y)^{n-k}\Bigl) $$
where $y$ must be calculated iteratively, as it is defined implicitly by $g(\theta)=0$, as follows:
$$
g(\theta) = -1 + \frac{a\cdot \theta_2}{\ln \bigl(\frac{-y}{y - 1} \bigl) - \theta_1} + \frac{b\cdot \theta_4}{\ln \bigl(\frac{-y}{y - 1} \bigl) - \theta_3}
$$</p>

<p>($n$, $k$, $a$, and $b$ are constants).</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, using partial implicit differentiation, the gradient (first partial derivative with respect to $\theta_i$) would be defined by $$
\frac{\partial \operatorname{f}}{\partial \operatorname{\theta_i}} = \frac{\frac{\partial \operatorname{f}}{\partial \operatorname{y}}\cdot \frac{-\partial \operatorname{g}}{\partial \operatorname{\theta_i}}}{\frac{\partial \operatorname{g}}{\partial \operatorname{y}}}
$$
This seems to match numerical approximations computed by R, but when I try to calculate the Hessian by taking the partial derivative of the gradient with respect to $\theta_i$, I get strange results that are nowhere close to numerical approximations.</p>

<p>This is the formula I came up as my attempt at calculating the Hessian (second-order mixed partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $\theta_i$):</p>

<p>$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \operatorname{\theta_i}} \Bigl(\frac{\partial \operatorname{f}}{\partial \operatorname{\theta_j}}\Bigl) = \frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial \operatorname{\theta_i}} \Bigl(\frac{\partial \operatorname{f}}{\partial \operatorname{y}}\Bigl) \cdot \frac{-\partial \operatorname{g}}{\partial \operatorname{\theta_i}}}{\frac{\partial \operatorname{g}}{\partial \operatorname{y}}}+
\frac{\frac{\partial \operatorname{f}}{\partial \operatorname{y}} \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial \operatorname{\theta_i}} \Bigl(\frac{-\partial \operatorname{g}}{\partial \operatorname{\theta_i}}\Bigl)}{\frac{\partial \operatorname{g}}{\partial \operatorname{y}}}+
\frac{\frac{\partial \operatorname{f}}{\partial \operatorname{y}} \cdot  \frac{-\partial \operatorname{g}}{\partial \operatorname{\theta_i}}\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial \operatorname{\theta_i}}\Bigl(\frac{\partial \operatorname{g}}{\partial \operatorname{y}}\Bigl)}{\Bigl(\frac{-\partial \operatorname{g}}{\partial \operatorname{y}}\Bigl)^2}
$$</p>

<p>Considering that the values I get from these calculations don't match (not even close) the automatically generated numerical approximations returned by R, I suspect that I've done something wrong here. Can anyone spot an error with the Hessian formula? Is there a property of higher-order mixed partial implicit differentiation that requires a different approach?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>UPDATE: Alecos Papadopoulos posted a solution that eliminates the need for iteration by solving directly for $g(\theta)$, thus providing an exact value for $y$. This works perfectly for this problem, as the calculation of the gradient and Hessian does not require implicit differentiation in this case!</p>

<p>For proof of concept (and in case I come across any $g(\theta)$ functions that can't be solved directly), I'm still interested in figuring out what went wrong with my attempt at the Hessian. If anyone has any insight into a general solution for the Hessian using implicit differentiation, it is certainly welcome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In most applications of the Wilcoxon procedure, the cases in which
  there is zero difference between $X_A$ and $X_B$ are at this point
  eliminated from consideration, since they provide no useful
  information, and the remaining absolute differences are then ranked
  from lowest to highest, with tied ranks included where appropriate.</p>

<p>The reason why I think this is madness is:</p>

<p>Ok, same value pairs do not change the value of the statistic, but they <strong>change the z-score</strong>. Imagine having a sample of $10^{1000}$ pairs while in $10$ pairs, the second value is higher and in all the remaining pairs, the values are the same. According to the above mentioned articles, we should discard these $10^{1000}-10$ pairs since they ""provide no useful information"" and consider only the remaining $10$ pairs. But those $10^{1000} - 10$ pairs <strong>do provide useful information</strong>. They scream in favor of the null hypothesis.</p>

<p>As you have discovered, this is only true for balanced, complete (i.e., no missing data) datasets with no continuous predictors. In other words, for the kinds of data/models discussed in classical ANOVA texts. Under these ideal circumstances, the fixed effects and random effects can be estimated independent of one another.</p>

<p>When these conditions do not hold (as they very very often do not in the ""real world""), the fixed and random effects are not independent. As an interesting aside, this is why ""modern"" mixed models are estimated using iterative optimization methods, rather than being exactly solved with a bit of matrix algebra as in the classical mixed ANOVA case: in order to estimate the fixed effects, we have to know the random effects, but in order to estimate the random effects, we have to know the fixed effects! More relevant to the present question, this also means that when data are unbalanced/incomplete and/or there are continuous predictors in the model, then adjusting the random-effects structure of the mixed model can alter the estimates of the fixed part of the model, and vice versa. </p>

<p>Edit 2016-07-05. From the comments: ""<em>Could you elaborate or provide a citation on why continuous predictors will influence the estimates of the fixed part of the model?</em>""</p>

<p>The estimates for the fixed part of the model will depend on the estimates for the random part of the model -- that is, the estimated variance components -- if (but not only if) the variance of the <em>predictors</em> differs across clusters.

<p>The intuition of BIR is as follows: a bettor is rewarded not just for identifying the ultimate winners and losers (0's and 1's), but more importantly for identifying the appropriate odds. Furthermore, it goes a step ahead and compares all predictions with the prior probabilities. </p>

As a note, you treat the correct and incorrect classifications differently as shown in the equations.

  <p>It seems that k-fold cross-validation error is very sensitive to the type of performance measure. It also has an error in itself because the training and validation sets are chosen randomly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you've discovered the high variance of performance measures that are proportions of case counts such as $\frac{\text{# correct predictions}}{\text{# test cases}}$. You try to estimate e.g. the probability that your classifier returns a correct answer. From a statistics point of view, that is described as a Bernoulli trial, leading to a binomial distribution. You can calculate confidence intervals for binomial distributions and will find that they are very wide. This of course limits your ability to do model comparison.</p>

<p>With resampling validation schemes such as cross validation you have an additional source of variation: the instability of your models (as you build $k$ surrogate models during each CV run)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, changing the number of folds gives me different optimal parameter values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is to be expected due to the variance. You may have an additional effect here: libSVM splits the data only once if you use their built-in cross validation for tuning. Due to the nature of SVMs, if you built the SVM with identical training data and slowly vary the parameters, you'll find that support vectors (and consequently accuracy) jumps: as long as the SVM parameters are not too different, it will still choose the same support vectors. Only when the paraters are changed enough, suddenly different support vectors will result. So evaluating the SVM parameter grid with exactly the same cross validation splits may hide variability, which you see between different runs.</p>

<p>IMHO the basic problem is that you do a grid search, which is an optimization that relies on a reasonably smooth behaviour of your target functional (accuracy or whatever else you use). Due to the high variance of your performance measurements, this assumption is violated. The ""jumpy"" dependence of the SVM model also violates this assumption. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accuracy metrics for cross validation may be overly optimistic. Usually anything over a 2-fold cross-validation gives me 100% accuracy. Also, the error rate is discretized due to small sample size. Model selection will often give me the same error rate across all or most parameter values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is to be expected given the general problems of the approach.</p>

<p>However, usually it is possible to choose really extreme parameter values where the classifier breaks down. IMHO the parameter ranges where the SVMs work well is important information. </p>

<p>In any case you absolutely need an external (double/nested) validation of the performance of the model you choose as 'best'. </p>

<p>I'd probably do a number of runs/repetitions/iterations of an outer cross validation or an outer out-of-bootstrap validation and give the distribution of </p>

<ul>
<li>hyperparameters for the ""best"" model</li>
<li>reported performance of the tuning</li>
<li>observed performance of outer validation</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference between the last two is an indicator of overfitting (e.g. due to ""skimming"" the variance).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When writing a report, how would I know that a classification is 'good' or 'acceptable'? In the field, it seems like we don't have something like a goodness of fit or p-value threshold that is commonly accepted. Since I am adding to the data iteratively, I would like to know when to stop- what is a good N where the model does not significantly improve?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(What are you adding? Cases or variates/features?)</p>

<p>First of all, if you do an iterative modeling, you either need to report that due to your fitting procedure your performance is not to be taken seriously as it is subject to an optimistic bias. The better alternative is to do a validation of the final model. However, the test data of that must be independent of all data that ever went into training or your decision process for the modeling (so you may not have any such data left).</p>

As I have explained in my answer, the multiply imputed datasets can be analyzed using the combined <code>Zelig</code> and <code>mitools</code> packages or using a combination of <code>Zelig</code> and <code>mice</code>.</p>

<p>Now, to me it seemed rather inconvenient to fit the linear model using <code>zelig()</code> as <code>mice</code>, too, provides the <code>with.mids()</code>-function to fit linear models to multiply imputed datasets. However, I found that the results differ depending on the function used for fitting. For the analysis using <code>with.mids</code>, I first had to circumvent a bug in the current <code>mice</code>-package by defining the following function, as has been explained in <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/71908/14646"">another question</a>:</p>

<pre><code>as.mids2 &lt;- function(data2, .imp=1, .id=2){
  ini &lt;- mice(data2[data2[, .imp] == 0, -c(.imp, .id)], maxit=0)
  names  &lt;- names(ini$imp)
  if (!is.null(.id)){
    rownames(ini$data) &lt;- data2[data2[, .imp] == 0, .id]
  }
  for (i in 1:length(names)){
    for(m in 1:(max(as.numeric(data2[, .imp])) - 1)){
      if(!is.null(ini$imp[[i]])){
        indic &lt;- data2[, .imp] == m &amp; is.na(data2[data2[, .imp]==0, names[i]])
        ini$imp[[names[i]]][m] &lt;- data2[indic, names[i]]
      }
    }
  }
  return(ini)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once I had done this, I used <code>Zelig</code>:</p>

<pre><code>library(""Amelia"")
data(freetrade)
amelia.out &lt;- amelia(freetrade, m = 15, ts = ""year"", cs = ""country"")

library(""Zelig"")

library(""mice"")
zelig4mice &lt;- as.mira(zelig.results)
zelig.mice.res &lt;- summary(pool(zelig4mice, method = ""rubin1987""))
</code></pre>

<p>Then I tried the same thing using only <code>mice</code>:</p>

<pre><code>imp.data &lt;- do.call(""rbind"", amelia.out$imputations)
imp.data &lt;- rbind(freetrade, imp.data)
imp.data$.imp &lt;- as.numeric(rep(c(0:15), each = nrow(freetrade)))

You will have to search and replace to put in your example.  I recommend against trying to explain it in general.  Laymen are pretty much never interested in that.  How about (maybe too long?):</p>

<p>The partial effect of credit score on default probability is the amount that default probability goes up (or down) when credit score rises by one point and all other factors stay the same.  Think about two people, one with a credit score of 650 and one with a credit score of 651.  In all other respects (income, time on job, loan-to-value ratio, etc), they are identical.  The one with the higher credit score will have a lower probability of default.  The probability may only be a tiny, tiny bit lower since this is such a small difference in credit scores, but, because everything else is the same, it will be lower.  This difference in default probabilities between a person with a credit score of 650 and a credit score of 651 but with everything else identical is the partial effect of credit score on default probability.</p>

<p>There are two complications, though.  First, the difference in default probability between a person with a 650 score and a 651 credit score will not be the same as the difference in default probability between someone with a 750 and 751 credit score.   Second, the 650 vs 651 difference in default probability will depend on their other characteristics.  Two low income people, one with a 650 and one with a 651, may have a larger difference in default probability than two high income people, one with a 650 score and one with a 651.</p>

<p>To deal with these complications, we first calculate a personalized partial effect, the difference in default probabilities due to a one point increase in credit score, for each person in the sample.  Then, we average over these personalized partial effects to give the average partial effect.  This is called the ""average partial effect"" of credit scores on default probabilities.</p>

<p>From page 275:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] it is important to recognize that the goal of identifying latent constructs (i.e., understanding the structure of correlations among measured variables) is different from that of data reduction. Data reduction involves taking scores on a large set of measured variables and reducing them to scores on a smaller set of composite variables that retain as much information from the original variables as possible. Data reduction does not attempt to model the structure of correlations among the original variables.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>If the goal is to arrive at a parsimonious representation of the associations among measured variables, EFA can be an appropriate form of analysis. If the goal is data reduction, principal components analysis (PCA) is more appropriate.</p>

58109,22399.0,1,,,,Interpretation of regression coefficients in the presence of modest correlations,<regression><multicollinearity>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I have a multiple regression model where I have nearly 20 independent variables. These variables are modestly correlated with each other (e.g., the maximum VIF is around 4 with most of them in the 2s).</p>

<p>One of the coefficients is statistically significant and is negative when I expected that it would be positive. I know that 'wrong signs' can be because of several reasons such as multi-collinearity, missing data, omitted variables etc but I am wondering if there is a simpler explanation for the 'wrong sign'.</p>

<p>The usual interpretation of the coefficients is that it represents the impact on the dependent variable when we change the independent variable by 1 unit holding everything else constant. </p>

<p>However, the above interpretation is accurate only if the independent variables are completely uncorrelated with one another. In the presence of modest correlations among the independent variables, when we increase one of them by 1 unit the others are also bound to go up/down by a modest amount (depending on the sign of the correlation) and hence the only way to predict the impact of a unit change of an independent variable is to evaluate its impact on the other independent variables and then assess the overall impact on the dependent variable. When we do such an analysis we may well discover that the 'wrong sign' is a non-issue as increasing that variable by 1 unit may result in an increase in the dependent variable via the changes in the other independent variables in the model.</p>

<p>Does the above explanation make sense or am I missing something?</p>

I am currently running the 216 cases batch experiment, limited to 30 epochs training. Still, I would like to <em>visualise</em> my results. Actually, I do have a testing (and training) accuracy function per case, whereas above I just picked its maximum.</p>

58113,19331.0,2,,58104.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>For (a), a simple way to look at is that you've reduced your probability space to only the combinations that have at least one boy:</p>

<pre><code>BB = 1/3
BG = 1/3
GB = 1/3
</code></pre>

<p>GG is no longer a possibility based on the fact that your neighbor said he had at least one boy.  Of the possibilities remaining, you're left with a 2/3 probability that he has a girl.  The information he gave you reduced the probability of him having a girl from 3/4 to 2/3. Formally, this can be shown as follows:  $$P(At\ least\ one\ girl|At\ least\ one\ boy) = \frac{P(At\ least\ one\ girl\ \cap At\ least\ one\ boy)}{P(At\ least\ one\ boy)}  $$
From your original box, we can see the probability of having at least one boy and at least one girl is BG + GB = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5, but we need to divide by the probability of at least one boy, which is BB + BG + GB = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75, so we get $\frac{\tfrac{1}{2}}{\tfrac{3}{4}} = \frac{2}{3}$.</p>

<p>For (b), now that we've seen a boy, the only uncertainty remaining is the gender of the other child, and given no other information, the probability of the other child being female is 1/2, which is the answer.</p>

<p>I would say the interpretation is accurate even with multicollinearity, but the <em>ceteris paribus</em> coefficient is not the quantity you care about. If you believe that the multicollinearity arises from an approximate linear relationship among some of the regressors, that relationship could be formalized either through some constraint on the parameters (such as dropping a variable or something more) or with a simultaneous equation approach. Without more details about the nature of your problem, it's hard to be more specific.

Of course something being an outlier on one measure does not necessarily mean it will be an outlier on other measures, but I think it certainly increases the odds. In essence, I think anything being unusual in one way is more likely to be unusual in other ways. This is perhaps the result of different variables being correlated in all kinds of ways. So if one is ""extreme"", this will also correlate with other factors that might also be in the extreme range.</p>

<p>I hope someone can provide a better answer with some empirical evidence. Perhaps we can look at this from the multivariate outlier perspective. In my experience, individuals who are outliers on one variable are often outliers on many other variables as well, contributing to multivariate outlierness. </p>

Typically, people will use Fisher's $z$-transformation (arctan) to turn the $r$ into a variable that is approximately normally distributed:<br>
$$
z_r = \frac 1 2 \ln \frac{1 + r}{1 - r}

Having applied this transformation, the standard error will be approximately $^1/_{\sqrt{(N-3)}}$.  With this you can form whatever length confidence interval you like.  Once you've found the confidence limits you want, you can back-transform them to the original $r$ scale (i.e., $[-1, 1]$) like so:<br>
$$
\text{CI limit}_r = \frac{\exp(2z) - 1}{\exp(2z) + 1}
$$
In other words, you <em>can</em> form a confidence interval for $r$ without the original data, so long as you have the original $N$.  </p>

<p><sub><em>Notes</em>: This approach is an approximation, there are exact formulae listed on the Wikipedia page, but they are harder to use.  Although it doesn't say on the Wikipedia page, there are several conditions you want to meet in order for this approximation to be reasonable.  The $N$ should be at least $30$ (IIRC), and the marginal distributions (i.e., the univariate distributions of the two variables being correlated) should be normal.  For example, I'm not sure that this will be accurate if the correlation were composed of two vectors of $1$s and $0$s.  However, higher $N$ should allow you to compensate for minor non-normality.</sub></p>

Now my question is if I want to sample from $p(\theta|y)$, them basically I have to do one Gibbs sampling(for example) to sample from distribution and at any point I have to run Monte Carlo method on the point to calculate $p(\theta|y)$'s value right? i.e. it needs two loops, one inside of the other. Is this correct?</p>

<p>As I got an answer to this question and I thought maybe my question is vague I will try to clarify it a bit more:</p>

<p>From what I know by reading for a week the whole time about Monte Carlo method and MCMC, I understood(correct me if I am wrong) that:
$$p(\theta|y)=\frac{p(y|\theta)p(\theta)}{\int_{\Theta}{p(y|\theta)p(\theta)}\text{d}\theta}.$$</p>

<p>Now if you consider that we only have a sampling algorithm for $\theta$ and we can only calculate $p(y|\theta)$ explicitly(and not the other functions!), therefore to get values from $p(\theta|y)$ one needs to numerically integrate the denominator. And for each value of this posterior one needs to apply a sampling scheme like Gibbs sampling to generate a sample of $p(\theta|y)$; each new transition in the parameter space should then sample from the distribution which is $p(\theta|y)$ here and to calculate that the above proportion should be computed. </p>

For example, the likelihood of a tsunami occurring and disrupting the supply chain, without additional data, can be estimated by an expert in the subject (there are better methods for constructing priors). As time passes, tsunamis occur and, as a result, we gain more data, and can update our priors (engineering knowledge) with posteriors (priors adjusted for new data). At some point, there will be so much data that the initial prior is irrelevant, and no matter whom made the prediction, you will have equal predictions of likelihood.  </p>

58143,5448.0,2,,58131.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>We don't use MCMC to calculate the $p(\theta | y)$ for each value (or many values) of $\theta$.  What MCMC (or the special case of Gibbs sampling) does is generate a (large) random sample from $p(\theta | y)$.  Note that $p(\theta | y)$ is not being calculated; you have to do something with that vector (or matrix) of random numbers to estimate $p(\theta)$.  Since you're not calculating $p(\theta)$ for lots of values of $\theta$, you don't need a Gibbs (or MCMC) loop inside a $\theta$ loop - just one (long) Gibbs (or MCMC) loop.</p>

<p>EDIT in response to an update to the question:  We do not need to integrate the distribution to get the constant of integration (CoI)!  The whole value of MCMC is is found in situations where we can't calculate the CoI.  Using MCMC, we can still generate random numbers from the distribution.  If we could calculate the CoI, we could just calculate the probabilities directly, without the need to resort to simulation.</p>

<p>Once again, we are NOT calculating $p(\theta|y)$ using MCMC, we are generating random numbers from $p(\theta|y)$ using MCMC.  A very different thing.</p>

<p>Here's an example from a simple case: the posterior distribution for the scale parameter from an Exponential distribution with a uniform prior.  The data is in <code>x</code>, and we generate <code>N &lt;- 10000</code> samples from the posterior distribution.  Observe that we are only calculating $p(x|\theta)$ in the program.</p>

<pre class=""lang-r prettyprint-override""><code>x &lt;- rexp(100)

   if (runif(1) &lt; alpha) cur_theta &lt;- prop_theta
   theta[i] &lt;- cur_theta
}

hist(theta)
</code></pre>

<p>And the histogram:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ZNFl.png"" alt=""Posterior distribution of $\theta$""></p>

<p>Note that the logic is simplified by our choice of sampler (the <code>prop_theta</code> line), as a couple of other terms in the next line (<code>alpha &lt;- ...</code>) cancel out, so don't need to be calculated at all.  It's also simplified by our choice of a uniform prior.  Obviously we can improve this code a lot, but this is for expository rather than functional purposes.</p>

You can test against point values and either exclude them or not exclude them. But the nature of statistics is that it is about examining variable data. Because there is always variance then there will necessarily be no way to know that something is exactly not related, normal, gaussian, etc. You can only know a range of values for it. You could know if a value is excluded from the range of plausible values. For example, it's easy to exclude no relationship and give range of values for how big the relationship is.</p>

<p>Therefore, trying to demonstrate no relationship, essentially the point value of <code>relationship = 0</code> is not going to meet with success. If you have a range of measures of relationship that are acceptable as approximately 0. Then it would be possible to devise a test.</p>

<p>This is a very hard problem in general, though your variables are apparently only 1d so that helps. Of course, the first step (when possible) should be to plot the data and see if anything pops out at you; you're in 2d so this should be easy.</p>
<p>Here are a few approaches that work in <span class=""math-container"">$\mathbb{R}^d$</span> or even more general settings, to match the general title of the question.</p>
<p>One general category is, related to the suggestion here, to estimate the mutual information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimate mutual information via entropies, as mentioned. In low dimensions with sufficient samples, histograms / KDE / nearest-neighbour estimators should work okay, but expect them to behave very poorly as the dimension increases. In particular, the following simple estimator has finite-sample bounds (compared to most approaches' asymptotic-only properties):</li>

The following paper gives a nice overview of the relationship between various estimators. Be aware, however, that these approaches are highly dependent on the neural network class and optimization scheme, and can have <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06222"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">particularly surprising behaviour in their bias/variance tradeoffs</a>.</li>

<p>There are also other approaches, based on measures other than the mutual information.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Schweizer-Wolff approach is a classic one based on copula transformations, and so is invariant to monotone increasing transformations. I'm not very familiar with this one, but I think it's computationally simpler but also maybe less powerful than most of the other approaches here.

All spices have a relative long ""transport distance"" and a relative long shelf life and hence a pretty small impact on the sales price compared to e.g. meat.

<p>But it sounds like you are also trying to do inference -- how much does an exogenous change in $X$ change $Y$.  Causal inferential statistics uses different methods and has different priorities than predictive statistics.  It is particularly well developed in econometrics.

<p>With one variable on each side, a residual plot (meaning, a plot of residual $y - \hat y =: e$ versus fitted or predicted $\hat y$) in principle shows just the same information as a scatter plot with regression line superimposed. On the latter, the residuals are just the vertical differences between the data points and the line and the fitted are the corresponding values on the line, i.e. for the same value of $x$. </p>

<p>In practice, a residual plot can make structure in the residuals more evident: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The regression line is rotated to the horizontal. Seeing structure in anything is easiest when the reference indicating no structure is a horizontal straight line, here the line $e = 0$. </p></li>
<li><p>There is better use of space. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In this easy example, some structure in the residuals is discernible in the scatter plot </p>

<p>but even easier to see in the residual plot: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HN2BZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The recipe here was simple. The data were fabricated as a quadratic plus Gaussian noise, but the quadratic is only roughly captured by the naive linear fit. </p>

<p>But it is still generally true that structure is easier to see on a residual plot. Some caution is needed in not over-interpreting residual plots, especially with very small sample sizes. As usual, what you spot should make scientific or practical sense too. </p>

<p>What if the fitted is more complicated than $b_0 + b_1 x$? There are two cases: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Everything can still be shown on a scatter plot, e.g. the right-hand side is a polynomial or something in trigonometric functions of $x$. Here, if anything, the residual plot is even more valuable in mapping everything so that zero residual is a reference. </p></li>
<li><p>The model uses two or more predictors. Here also the residual plot can be invaluable as a kind of health check showing how well you did and what you missed. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The health check analogy is a fair one more generally: Residual plots can help you spot if something is wrong. If nothing is evidently wrong, no news is good news, but there is no absolute guarantee: something important may have been missed. </p>

<p>On whether the predictor had a significant effect, I know of no rule whatever for drawing or not drawing a residual plot. In the concocted example here, significance levels and figures of merit such as $R^2$ are extremely good, but the straight line model still misses a key part of the real structure. Conversely, a residual plot often illuminates why a model failed to work: either the pattern really is all noise, so far as can be seen, or your model misses something really important, such as some nonlinearity. </p>

<li>How can I conceptualize the prior of a deterministic variable in Bayesian data analysis? </li>

<p>Formally, deterministic variables don't have a probability distribution (yes you guessed it, since they are not random variables!). No random variable => no prior.</p>

<ul>
<li>Now, as far as I understand the first is a deterministic variable and
the second is stochastic.</li>

<p>If by first you mean $\lambda_C$, since it is a function of r.v. $\sigma$, IT IS a random variable.
(just a side note: usually you reserve the term ""stochastic"" for random quantities involving time, such as a stochastic process)</p>

<ul>
<li>However, I have problems conceptualizing the prior of the deterministic variable.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I answered this in the first comment. But let me elaborate. In Bayesian statistics there are multiple ways how you can treat a parameter, depending on your previous knowledge. In general you assume the parameter to have an uncertain value, and consider it random. Depending on your beliefs and prior knowledge about its values you can either, use a uniform distribution, or a distribution that favors a certain value, e.g. if you know the precision is most likely centered around a certain value, you can use a Gamma($\alpha$,$\beta$) distributed prior with appropriate values $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Now here is the point that might be tripping you up. Priors are there since sometimes you have a strong belief, but usually you will not be a 100% certain about the value of a certain parameter. 
Technically, that case can be considered a random variable, with a point mass. But that is completely beyond the point. Priors help model uncertainty of parameters.
Deterministic parameters in the model are something completely different. They are unknowns, that you decide to model as single values without any uncertainty.</p>

<ul>
<li>How would you, for example, plot the graph of the prior?</li>
</ul>

<p>By plotting its probability distribution.</p>

<ul>
<li>How would I even calculate the single values for the prior of $\lambda_C$?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure what you mean here. I hope by now you can see this question makes no sense.</p>

<p>Your graph is exactly what I explained. Just take away the negative values with an imaginary y=0 line. As you can see there are many data points the X of which is either 0 or very small, and Y has pretty high value. However there is no data point that have y=0 and x is quite high value. And as you can see it makes the data scatter shape a right angle triangle. Thus we could say that the high X values necessitates high Y values but high Y values does not always have high X values. I find it very interesting. In practice for example I measure Complexity and Size of given entities. And my analysis show that all complex entities have big size but not all big-size entities are complex. Then I conclude that the certain amount of complexity requires defined amount of size. You cannot put more complexity in a given size. This is a bit abstract but you see my point? It is very interesting and I would like to get some help on how this kind of relationships are discussed or described in statistics formally.</p>

<p>So, what I get is like: $x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0, x_3 = 0, x_4 = 0, x_5 = 0, x_6 = 1....$, i.e., $X_t \in \{0,1,2,3,4,5,...\}$ where $t = 0,1,2,...,T-1,T$. As we can see, I observe jumps greater then one for particular $t$'s (like $t = 16, \rightarrow x_{16} = 5$).</p>

<p><strong>I want to investigate if more counts occur if $t$ moves towards $T$ and what the impacts of different covariates, captured in $\boldsymbol{X}$, are.</strong></p>

<p>To do that, I could assume that $N(t) = \sum_{i=1}^t X_t$ is a poisson-process, i.e.,</p>

<p>(1) $P(N(t) = k) = \frac{\lambda(t)t^{k}}{k!}\text{exp}\{-\lambda(t)t\}$</p>

<p>The regression model will be:</p>

<p>(2) $\text{log}\{E(N(t)|t)\} = \boldsymbol{X\beta + \epsilon}$</p>

<p>$\Leftrightarrow \text{log}\{\lambda(t)t\} = \boldsymbol{X\beta + \epsilon}$</p>

<p>$\Leftrightarrow \text{log}\{\lambda(t)\} = -\text{log}\{t\} + \boldsymbol{X\beta + \epsilon}$</p>

<p>In this case, I would model $-\text{log}\{t\}$ as the <em>offset-value</em> and take $N(t)$ as the dependend variable - which is just the cumsum of $X_i$, where $i$ goes from $1$ to $T$. </p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>
<em>I think here I'll get a problem because, as far as I remember, for particular $t$'s, the process is not supposed to jump by more then one?</em></p>

<p>Another way I could think of, is, that I see my data as a big cross-table. If I assume that each cell count is a realization of an independent poisson-process and the total count $n$ is fixed, then I'm able to say that I observe a set of counts $n_1,...,n_T$ which are each poissonian with rate $\lambda_t$. </p>

<p>If these assumptions hold, it can be shown that the cell counts are Multinomial$(\frac{\lambda_t}{n_1},...,\frac{\lambda_t}{n_T},n)$.</p>

<p>Hence, if I see the observations as a multinomial respones, for the cell counts $X_t$, I'll get the model:</p>

<p>(3) $\text{log}\{E(X_t)\}) = \boldsymbol{X\beta + \epsilon}$</p>

<p>$\Leftrightarrow \text{log}\{\lambda_t\} = \boldsymbol{X\beta + \epsilon}$</p>

<p>$\Leftrightarrow \text{log}\{np_t\} = \boldsymbol{X\beta + \epsilon}$</p>

<p>$\Leftrightarrow \text{log}\{p_t\} = -\text{log}\{n\} + \boldsymbol{X\beta + \epsilon}$</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong>
<em>Now, I would choose $-\text{log}\{n\}$ as my offset-value. If the sequence of $\lambda_t, \ \ t = 1,...,T$ is increasing in $t$, this would answer my question. Since my $n$ is actually fixed and with this approach I'm able to deal with the multiple jumps at some $t$ it seems that the model (3) would be the way to go?</em></p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong>
<em>If I use a <code>glm()</code> what would my dependend variable be? I thought about defining a new r.v. $Y_t$ which is 1 if $X_t&gt;0$ and zero otherwise. If $X_t&gt;1$ then I would duplicate the corresponding row $x_t$-times. If I do that, in my optinion, things are not supposed to change since I look at a ratio as a dependend variable anyway?</em></p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong>
<em>Another issue I've is, that in model (2) I'm not sure how (3) catches that moving towards $T$ the cumsum of $X_t$ inceases steadily, since (3) looks at each cell separately.</em></p>

How do I do this in Stata?</p>

<p>Ie. I need the test of the effect of A in the model on the dependent variable D, which tests the joint hypothesis that every one of the four levels of A has the same effect on D, and therefore A does not explain any of the variation in D, and so it is not a significant predictor of D in the model.

This is the real-world structure. Making an assumption that customers are reasonably rational (i.e. consistent in their opinions), it means that somehow, they, in their minds, construct some sort of ""weighted average"" in order to go from the partial scores to the overall score.  </p>

<p>Then you should use the regression approach, which reflects the above situation. Using partial correlation coefficients does not capture how one reasonably believes that the customers thought and acted when scoring the company.  </p>

<p>This regression is in the spirit of ""hedonic index regression"", if we view ""overall satisfaction"" as the ""price"" of the ""product"" named ""transacting with company"", and the regressors as ""features"" of the product (that are provided in different levels for each customer, and hence their variability).</p>

<p>If the rankings are consistently coded (say, a higher number means a higher level of satisfaction for the partial scores and for the overall score), then a higher estimated regression coefficient on a partial score will indicate that this aspect of the transaction ""bears more heavily"" (has a higher marginal effect) on ""overall satisfaction"", and so indeed, focusing and improving on the areas with the higher regression coefficients, should yield larger benefits in overall satisfaction.  </p>

<p>But also, in order to finally decide on the prioritization, one should also look how the various areas compare in average score. Say ""customer support"" has a higher regression coefficient than ""delivery"", but also, ""customer support"" is on average rated already very high by customers, compared to ""delivery"". Then the efforts to further improve ""customer support"" may be more costly and difficult, compared to improving ""delivery"". So while one unit of increase in customer support satisfaction may yield higher overall satisfaction increase compared to one unit increase in ""delivery"", this one unit increase may be more costly to achieve in customer satisfaction than in delivery, offsetting partially, or fully, the economic gains from the increase in ""overall satisfaction"".   </p>

<p>Since we can expect that a test at the 32% level will never be appropriate, why even show the SE bars since they will probably be interpreted as though they represent a confidence interval? Do people use SE bars instead of more meaningful CIs because it's moderately easier to calculate (e.g. using a built-in function in Excel)? It seems that we're paying a pretty high cost in terms of the interpretability of our graphic in exchange for a few minutes' less work. Is there some value/utility in SE bars that I'm missing?</p>

<p>For context, I was prompted to write this after skimming <a href=""http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Losing_and_Winning.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a>. I was frustrated by the lack of confidence intervals in the plots provided by the authors, and then when they did finally provide them, it turned out they were just SE bars. </p>

running (as much a possible) the same experimental  multiple times using the same setup and estimating the variance.  However, these statistical errors
are only very rarely used in a direct confidence interval/degree of significance

errors of various type are likely to be larger than the statistical errors, and these types of errors are not amenable to statistical analysis.  Thus, representing the 95% confidence interval based on just the statistical errors could be deceiving.  Experimental particle physicists in particular go to great pains to identify statistical uncertainties, systematic uncertainties and then combine them (in physics community approved ways) into confidence intervals (the preprints on the discovery of the Higgs boson are probably easily found examples of this).</p>

<p>Let's add some new information to each ticket $\omega$: next to the value of $X$ written on it, we will also write the value of $F_X(X(\omega))$: it is the proportion of all tickets with values of $X$ less than or equal to <em>this</em> value, $X(\omega).$  (It's the same concept as a percentile or quantile: the tickets with the smallest values of $X$ get the smallest proportions and the tickets with the largest values of $X$ get the largest proportions.)  These new values, being proportions, lie between $0$ and $1$ inclusive.  But, when $X$ is discrete, <em>they will not include all possible numbers,</em> but only the proportions that actually occur in the box.</p>

<p>Consider drawing a single ticket from this box at random. Fixing a number $a$ in advance, what is the chance that the <em>new</em> value (the ""quantile"") written on the ticket will not exceed $a$?  Of course it's the proportion of tickets with values of $a$ or lower.  But all such tickets, by construction, have values of $X$ that lie within the lower $100a\%$ of all the values.  Therefore this chance cannot exceed $a$.</p>

<p>The chance might be strictly less than $a$ when $a$ is not one of the actual proportions in the box.  Because it cannot be greater than $a$ and now cannot be equal to $a$ it <em>has</em> to be less than $a$!</p>

<p><strong>A simple example</strong> is afforded by a box with two tickets: on one of these $X$ equals $0$ and on the other it equals $1$.  When we write the proportions on the tickets, then, we will write $1/2$ (or $50\%$) on the first ticket (because half the tickets have values of $0$ or less) and $1$ (or $100\%$) on the second ticket (because all the tickets have values of $1$ or less).</p>

<p>What is the chance that this new value on a randomly drawn ticket will be less than or equal to $a=3/4$ (or $75\%$)?  Because the new values are only $50\%$ and $100\%$, and half of them are less than $75\%$, the answer obviously is $1/2$. This is strictly less than $a$ <em>because there are no proportions in the box between $50\%$ and $75\%$.</em>  The issue is just that trivial and simple.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pearson correlation measures linearity of relationship, not similarity of values. $y$ and $a + by$ have correlation $+1$ for $b &gt; 0$: make $a$ as different from zero or $b$ as large as you like, and the similarity is at best one of shape, not size. (Concordance correlation does measure agreement in the sense that $y = x$ is required for perfect positive correlation.) </p></li>
<li><p>Normality of distribution is not a requirement to measure correlation; correlation is perfectly well defined as a descriptive statistic (or even as a non-statistical property; it's just a cosine from one point of view) so long as both variables are genuinely variable. Marginal distribution is of concern if you wish to test for significance, e.g. produce a P-value. </p></li>

<p>What is the real problem? For assessing similarity of two time series, I would always start with plotting the series and examining (as appropriate) the difference or ratio between them.

Also, here as elsewhere, a single summary measure will rarely do justice to the fine structure of interesting data. </p>

Bernoulli process?,<mathematical-statistics><binomial-distribution><bernoulli-distribution>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I'm having trouble understanding how certain combinations of random variables can correlate. The problem is as follows:</p>

<p>I have a binary $m \times n$ matrix $A$ of full rank (over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_2$ with two elements), where each row has exactly $w$ $1$'s (i.e., their weights are all $w$).</p>

<p>I randomly pick an $n$-dimensional binary vector $\boldsymbol{v} = (v_0,\dots,v_{n-1}) \in \mathbb{F}_2^n$, where each $v_i$ is $1$ with probability $p$ and $0$ with probability $1-p$. The probability $p$ is assumed to be strictly smaller than $\frac{1}{2}$. Here, $v_i$ are all independent, so that picking $\boldsymbol{v}$ is seen as an i.i.d. Bernoulli process of probability $p$.</p>

<p>I am going to hash this vector $\boldsymbol{v}$ into an $m$-dimensional vector $\boldsymbol{v}' = (v'_0,\dots,v'_{m-1})$ by taking $\boldsymbol{v}' = A\boldsymbol{v}^T$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$. So, if I write the $i$th row of $A$ as $\boldsymbol{r}_i$, each $v'_i$ is the product $v'_i = \boldsymbol{r}_i\cdot\boldsymbol{v}^T$ between the $i$th row of $A$ and $\boldsymbol{v}$. In other words, I'm just taking the mod $2$ sum of some bits of $\boldsymbol{v}$.</p>

<p>Because the weight of $\boldsymbol{r}_i$ is assumed to be $w$, the probability $P(v'_i = 1)$ that the $i$th bit $v_i'$ of the hashed vector $\boldsymbol{v}'$ is $1$ is</p>

<p>$$P(v'_i = 1) = \sum_{x: \text{odd}}^{w}\binom{w}{x}p^x(1-p)^{w-x},$$</p>

<p>which is a constant if we fix $p$ and $w$, and is also uniform across all $v_i'$.</p>

<p>Now, if $A$ had linearly dependent rows, the hashed bits $v_i'$ are clearly not independent. My question is:</p>

<p><em><strong>What if all rows of $A$ are linearly independent? Is $\boldsymbol{v}'$ an i.i.d. Bernoulli process with probability $P(v'_i = 1)$? If not, can I approximate it as one if $\boldsymbol{r}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{r}_j$ have only few $1$'s at the same columns for all $i \not=j$?</em></strong></p>

<p>I remember I read in some research paper in electrical engineering that $\boldsymbol{v}'$ is i.i.d. Bernoulli if rows of $A$ are linearly independent, <strike>although I can't seem to remember where it was.</strike> (I found one recent paper that says this is the case: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.122810.102182"" rel=""nofollow"">V.

Lett. <strong>15</strong> (2011) 232–234.</a> It's Lemma 1 on the second page.) But now I think about it, this is counterintuitive (to me) because if two rows of $A$ have $1$ at the same column, that means that I took at least one same $v_i$ when hashing $\boldsymbol{v}$ for those two rows, so the corresponding $v_i'$ look correlated.</p>

<p>If my reasoning and Alecos Papadopoulos's answer are correct, the last part of the above question in boldface becomes essential. For instance, are there standard methods for evaluating how close or similar a given set of random variables like $\boldsymbol{v}'$ is to i.i.d. Bernoulli?</p>

<p>The problem doesn't seem to be that mean independence (the condition where $E[Y|X] = E[Y]$) implies that $Y$ and $X$ are uncorrelated. If $X$ and $Y$ are not correlated, it is not generally true that they are mean independent. So this doesn't seem problematic so far. </p>

<p>However, suppose you had a relationship (we can call it causal) defined as $Y = WX$, where $X$ is distributed with a standard normal distribution and $W$ is distributed with a Rademacher distribution so that $W = 1$ or $-1$, each with probability $1/2$ (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normally_distributed_and_uncorrelated_does_not_imply_independent"" rel=""nofollow"">see this Wikipedia article</a>). Then notice that $E[Y|X] = E[Y]$. Under your definition, this relationship would not be causa even though $Y$ clearly depends on $X$.</p>

<h2>An Example of a Formal Way of Thinking About Causality</h2>

<p>To give you maybe a clearer and more mathematical way to look at causality, take the following example. (I borrow this example from the book ""Mostly Harmless Econometrics."") Suppose you want to analyze the effect of hospitalization on health. Define $Y_i$ as some health measure of individual $i$ and $D_i \in \{0,1\}$ to indicate whether or not that individual was hospitalized. In our first attempt, suppose we look at the average difference in health of the two kinds of individuals:
$$
E[Y_i | D_i=1] - E[Y_i|D_i=0].
$$
On first look at the data, you might notice, counter intuitively, that individuals that have been hospitalized actually have worse health than those that have not. However, going to the hospital certainly does not make people sicker. Rather, there is a selection bias. People who go to the hospital are those people that are in worse health. So this first measure does not work. Why? Because we are not interested in just the <em>observed</em> differences, but rather in the potential differences (we want to know what would happen in the counter-factual world).</p>

<p>Define the potential outcome of any individual as follows:
$$
\text{Potential Outcome} = \left \{
\begin{array}{ll}
Y_{1,i} &amp; \text{if } D_i = 1 \\
Y_{0,i} &amp; \text{if } D_i = 0.
\end{array}
\right .
$$
$Y_{0,i}$ is the health of individual $i$ if he had not gone to the hospital, regardless of whether he actually went or not (we want to think about counterfactuals) and in the same way, $Y_{1,i}$ is the health of the individual is he did go. Now, write the actual observed outcome in terms of the potentials,
$$
Y_i = \left \{
\begin{array}{ll}
Y_{1,i} &amp; \text{if } D_i = 1 \\
Y_{0,i} &amp; \text{if } D_i = 0.
\end{array}
\right.
$$
Thus, $Y_i = Y_{0,i} + (Y_{1,i} - Y_{0,i}) D_i$. Now, we can define the causal effect as $Y_{1,i} - Y_{0,i}$. This works because it is in terms of potentials. Now, suppose we again look at the observed differences in average health:
\begin{align*}
E[Y_i | D_i=1] - E[Y_i|D_i=0] &amp;= E[Y_{1,i}|D_i = 1] - E[Y_{0,i}|D_i = 1] \\
    &amp; \qquad + E[Y_{0,i}|D_i=1] - E[Y_{0,i}|D_i=0].
\end{align*}
Notice that the term $E[Y_{1,i}|D_i = 1] - E[Y_{0,i}|D_i = 1]$ can be interpreted as the average treatment effect on the treated and $E[Y_{0,i}|D_i=1] - E[Y_{0,i}|D_i=0]$ as the bias in selection. Now, if the treatment $D_i$ is assigned randomly, then we have
\begin{align*}
E[Y_i | D_i=1] - E[Y_i|D_i=0] &amp;= E[Y_{1,i}|D_i] - E[Y_{0,i}|D_i=0] \\
    &amp;= E[Y_{1,i}|D_i] - E[Y_{0,i}|D_i=1] \\
    &amp;= E[Y_{1,i} - Y_{0,i}|D_i=1] \\
    &amp;= E[Y_{1,i} - Y_{0,i}],
\end{align*}
where we see that $E[Y_{1,i} - Y_{0,i}]$ is the average causal effect that we are interested in. This is a basic way of thinking about causality.</p>

<li><p>Graphical multiples, as already suggested by @Glen_b. Each series could be plotted separately.

<li><p>Looking at differences or ratios. One series of interest, or an average or other reference series, can be used to look at differences, or as appropriate ratios, of series rather than the series themselves. So, for example, plot (this series $-$ IBM) or (this series / IBM). If using ratios, then consider logarithmic scale too. (Ratios depend on all values being positive, or at least  having the same sign, to work.)  </p></li>
<li><p>Changing the aspect ratio. Erratic series with numerous changes of direction are often best plotted with an aspect ratio yielding short, long graphs, which you may need to split into different sections.

<li><p>Sampling. Do you need every value? Would plotting every $k$th value be as informative <em>visually</em>?

58261,20473.0,2,,58251.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p><strong>1) Meta-issue:</strong><br>
I believe the OP should include in the title of the question a signal that something special is going on here - for example instead of ""Are linear combinations of..."" the title should read ""Are $\mathbb{F}_2-$linear combinations of..."", so that the reader gets the message that concepts may have special meanings in this specific question.  </p>

<p><strong>2) Bernoulli or not Bernoulli?</strong><br>
By $\mathbb{F}_2-$arithmetic, the sum of i.i.d Bernoulli rv's is not a Binomial, since all probabilities are condensed on the values $0$ and $1$. We first derive the binomial distribution and then add the probabilities of all even values of the support to the probability of $0$, and the probabilities of all odd values of the support to the probability of $1$ -and thus we obtain again a Bernoulli r.v. This is just to validate the probability mass function included in the OP's question. It is  by construction a Bernoulli random variable, irrespective of how $P(v'_i = 1)$ is derived. Moreover if the number of $1$'s is the same in each row of the matrix $A$, then each $v'_i$ has an identical Bernoulli marginal distribution.</p>

<p><strong>3) $\mathbb{F}_2-$ linear independence.</strong><br>
$\mathbb{F}_2-$ linear dependence does not look much like the ""usual"" concept of linear independence. To be able to obtain a square matrix of full row/column rank under $\mathbb{F}_2-$arithmetic, I conjecture that $w$, the number of $1$'s in each row, should be an odd number. Consider a square matrix $n\times n$ matrix $A$, and the first element of one of its rows, say $a_{i1}$. I reason as follows:<br>
<strong>a)</strong> Assume $w$ is an even number.<br>
<em>a1)</em> Assume $a_{i1} = 0$. Then in the remaining $n-1$ elements of the row, there exists an even number of $1$'s, which by $\mathbb{F}_2-$arithmetic will give us $0$. The rest of the elements of the row all also zero, so overall the sum of the $n-1$ elements will give $0$, i.e equal to the value of the first element.<br>
<em>a2)</em> Assume $a_{i1} = 1$. Then in the remaining $n-1$ elements of the row, there exists an odd number of $1$'s, which by $\mathbb{F}_2-$arithmetic will give us $1$. The rest of the elements of the row are all zero, so overall the sum of the $n-1$ elements will give $1$, i.e again equal to the value of the first element.  </p>

<p>So if $w=even$, the  $\mathbb{F}_2-$sum of the $n-1$ columns will always equal the $n$-th column, depriving us of full rank.</p>

<p><strong>b)</strong> Assume $w$ is an odd number.<br>
<em>b1)</em> Assume $a_{i1} = 0$. Then in the remaining $n-1$ elements of the row, there exists an odd number of $1$'s, which by $\mathbb{F}_2-$arithmetic will give us $1$. The rest of the elements of the row all zero, so overall the sum of the $n-1$ elements will give $1$, i.e different to the value of the first element.<br>
<em>b2)</em> Assume $a_{i1} = 1$. Then in the remaining $n-1$ elements of the row, there exists an even number of $1$'s, which by $\mathbb{F}_2-$arithmetic will give us $0$. The rest of the elements of the row all also zero, so overall the sum of the $n-1$ elements will give $0$, i.e again different than the value of the first element.  </p>

<p>So it appears that $w= odd$, is at least a necessary condition to have a matrix $A$ of full column/row rank. </p>

<p><strong>4) Stochastic (in)dependence in the $\mathbb{F}_2-$world.</strong><br>
Does the characteristics of $\mathbb{F}_2-$field affect the <em>concept</em> of stochastic (in)dependence? No. Two r.v.'s are independent if and only if their joint distribution is the product of their marginals. Meaning, the conditional distributions must equal the unconditional ones. Maybe the way operations work in the $\mathbb{F}_2-$field produces some unexpected results?
Let's see: Assume that we have a square $A$ matrix that has $\mathbb{F}_2-$ linearly independent rows. The <em>column</em> vector process $\boldsymbol{v}'$, say of dimension $5\times 1$ is written</p>

<p>$$\boldsymbol{v}' = A\boldsymbol{v} = \left[\begin{matrix}
v_1'(v_0,...)\\
v_2'(v_0,...)\\
v_3'(v_0,...)\\
v_4'(v_0,...)\\
v_5'(v_0,...)\\
\end{matrix}\right]$$</p>

<p>Now assume that $w=3$ and, say, that the $1$'s in $A$ as dispersed such that we have</p>

<p>$$ v_2' = v_0+v_1+v_5,\qquad v_4' = v_2+v_3+v_5$$</p>

<p>Consider the conditional probability (under $\mathbb{F}_2-$ arithmetic)</p>

<p>$$P_{\mathbb{F}_2}(v_2' =1\mid v_4'=0) = P_{\mathbb{F}_2}(v_0+v_1+v_5 =1\mid v_2+v_3+v_5=0)$$</p>

<p>If the conditioning statement is to affect the probabilities of $v_2'$, it will do so through $v_5$: the fact that $v_2+v_3+v_5=0$ must affect the probabilities related to $v_5$. Under the ""usual"" arithmetic this would be obvious: it would mean that $v_5$ should equal zero. What happens under $\mathbb{F}_2-$ arithmetic?
We can examine
$$P_{\mathbb{F}_2}(v_5 =1\mid v_2+v_3+v_5=0) = \frac{P_{\mathbb{F}_2}(\{v_5 =1\}\land \{v_2+v_3+v_5=0\})}{P_{\mathbb{F}_2}(v_2+v_3+v_5=0)}$$</p>

<p>The possible values of $v_2+v_3+v_5$ under $\mathbb{F}_2-$ arithmetic are 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mZGnm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>from which we get the following contingency table</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zaeyX.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Therefore 
$$P_{\mathbb{F}_2}(v_5 =1\mid v_2+v_3+v_5=0) = \frac{2p^2(1-p)}{(1-p)^3+3p^2(1-p)}=\frac{2p^2}{1-2p+4p^2} \neq p$$
<em>except</em> when $p=1/2$ - but the set up explicitly specifies that $p&lt;1/2$ . So we conclude that 
$$P_{\mathbb{F}_2}(v_5 =1\mid v_2+v_3+v_5=0) \neq P_{\mathbb{F}_2}(v_5 =1)$$</p>

<p>and so 
$$P_{\mathbb{F}_2}(v_2' =1\mid v_4'=0) \neq P_{\mathbb{F}_2}(v_2' =1)$$</p>

<p>I have shown that, in general, the elements of the vector process $\boldsymbol{v}'$ are not independent (although they have identical marginals), even under $\mathbb{F}_2$-arithmetic. I have found and read the lemma in the paper the OP mentions. There is no actual proof, just a verbal assertion that they are independent, due to the $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear independence of the rows of $A$. Hopefully, I am mistaken, but for the moment it appears the assertion is not valid. </p>

<p><strong>5) Now what?</strong><br>
Not much. The joint distribution of the random vector will depend on how the $1$'s are allocated in matrix $A$. Without a specific form, the various measures of distance between distributions become vacuous. Intuitively, if $w$ is small relative to the length of the rows of $A$, then one can expect/hope, that the dependence will be relatively weak, and so pretending that the vector is i.i.d. won't hurt much... but without knowing the joint distribution, one cannot really tell... Copulas for discrete r.v.'s suffer from identification issues... I am still thinking about it, but I am not optimistic.</p>

<p>So if you accept that this assumption holds, as you indicate in a comment, and so the OLS estimator for each sample has the unbiasedness property, then <strong>a combination of the two will be unbiased if it is a linear combination with weights adding up to unity (but not necessarily a convex combination)</strong>.

So further dividing this operative effect size by $\sqrt{1-r}$ would not make sense, because that correction is already ""built in"" to that instantiation of $d$. </p>

<p>I think @John has a good brief discussion of different ways of computing $d$ at the bottom of his answer <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/30261/cohens-d-for-paired-vs-independent-samples-and-which-pooled-sd-to-use-for-coh"">HERE</a>. John mentions that some people firmly believe that $d$ should always be computed using the classical, independent-groups specificaton. I am one of these people. (Cohen was also one of these people. That's why he used the separate term ""operative effect size"" to talk about other ways of computing $d$.) I think it is a very bad idea to give $d$ different definitions in different contexts. Aside from the important problem this creates of killing any possible comparison of $d$ sizes between experimental paradigms that tend to use different designs, this inconsistent definition of $d$ also fosters confusion about what any given person means when they speak of $d$, unless they explicitly say which $d$ they mean! I believe this latter confusion is exactly what we have experienced here.</p>

<p>The ""operative effect size"" language convention is an attempt to allow us to talk sensibly and unambiguously about these nonstandard, but still useful, definitions of $d$ (nonstandard in the sense that they deviate from Cohen's definition). In case you are wondering, I believe Cohen calls these ""operative"" effect sizes because they are the effect sizes that are relevant for conducting a power analysis, which is what makes them useful. But let's keep in mind that this is only <em>one</em> of the uses of an effect size measure.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write the joint posterior density, $p( \theta, \phi|y)$, in unnormalized

the hyperparameters $\phi$; for fixed observed $y$, this is a function
of $\phi$, $p(\theta|\phi, y)$.</p></li>
<li><p>Estimate $\phi$ using the Bayesian paradigm; that is, obtain its
marginal posterior distribution, $p(\phi|y)$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first step is immediate, and the second step is easy for conjugate models
because, conditional on $t/J$, the population distribution for $\theta$ is just the iid
model (5.1), so that the conditional posterior density is a product of conjugate
posterior densities for the components $\theta_j$.
The third step can be performed by brute force by integrating the joint
posterior distribution over $\theta$:
$$p(\phi|y) = \int{p(\phi,\theta|y)d\theta} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(5.4)}""$$</p>

Most of my data is left truncated, and I'm not sure if I'm entering it into the <code>Surv</code> function correctly. My response variable is time (measured in years) beginning from when a bridge is classified as deficient, and ending when it collapses. I can track each bridge's deficiency status from 2012 back to 1992, but no further. The censoring occurs because many bridges were classified as deficient from the time of their collapse back to 1992, and thus I don't know exactly when they became deficient, and therefore I don't know their true ""lifetime"" (number of years from deficient classification to collapse). Say for example a bridge collapsed in 1995, and was classified as being deficient in 1995, 1994, 1993, and 1992. It is possible that it was first classified as being deficient in 1992, it is also possible that it has been classified as deficient since 1984. Thus I believe my censoring is considered to be left truncated.</p>

<p>Some example data:</p>

<pre><code>Year0 = c(1992, 1992, 1999, 1992, 1993, 2007, 2005, 1992) # The years when each bridge     was first observed as being deficient.
Year1 = c(1993, 1994, 2002, 1996, 2004, 2012, 2011, 2000) # The years in which each bridge collapsed
Defyears = Year1 - Year0 + 1 # The number of years for wich I can observe each bridge being deficient
time1 = Year0 - 1992 # Since I want the time scale to be from 0 to 21 instead of 1992 - 2012, I subtract 1992 from each time observation.
                     # This now becomes the beginning point for the lifetime of each bridge.
time2 = Defyears + time1 # This is the ending point of the lifetime of each bridge.
n = length(time2)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that four out of the eight bridges are left truncated, bridge 1, 2, 4, and 8. I cannot observe exactly when they were first classified as being deficient. For bridges 3, 5, 6, and 7 I know their exact lifetimes since they became deficient after 1992, hence these observations are not censored.</p>

<p>I then fit the model:</p>

<pre><code>bridges = survfit(Surv(time = time1, time2 = time2, event = rep(1,n)) ~ 1) # I do ""event = rep(1,n)"" because each bridge collapsed.
</code></pre>

<p>I'm just not sure that this model is correct. For one thing, in the documentation it says that <code>time</code> is for right censored data or the starting time for interval censored data. For another, I don't see how this model accounts for the observations that aren't censored. Can anyone tell me if this is right, and if not, what I need to change and why. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!</p>

<p>I have tried to start thinking intuitively about it like follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>High Multicollinearity means that in a matrix, two or more rows/columns are linearly dependent on each other. In other words, in a 3-dimensional space there are 2 vectors which have (almost) the same direction only different magnitudes (is this right?)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd appreciate it if someone could explain how this translates into ""multicollinearity not affecting the regression as a whole but only individual variable's coefficient estimates"".</p>

<p>Also, could someone explain the statement in bold? I cant make sense out of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One other thing to keep in mind is that the tests on the individual
  coefficients each assume that all of the other predictors are in the

58294,21762.0,2,,58293.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Let us first distinguish between <em>perfect</em> multi-collinearity (model matrix not of full rank, so that usual matrix inversions fail. Usually due to misspecification of the predictors) and <em>non-perfect</em> multi-collinearity (some of the predictors are correlated without leading to computational problems). This answer is about the second type, which occurs in almost any multivariable linear model since the predictors have no reason to be uncorrelated. </p>

<p>A simple example with strong multi-collinearity is a quadratic regression. So the only predictors are $X_1 = X$ and $X_2=X^2$:</p>

<p><em>1. Multicollinearity doesnt affect the regression of the model as a whole.</em></p>

<p>Let's have a look at an example model:</p>

<p><em>Global</em> statements about the model are just fine: </p>

<ul>
<li>R-Squared: $X$ explains about 71% of the variability of $Y$</li>
<li>Global F-test: At the 5% level, there is really an association between $X$ and $Y$</li>
<li>Predictions: For persons with $X$-value 2, a best guess for his $Y$-value is 
$$

$$</li>
</ul>

<p><em>2. But if we start looking at the effect of individual variable Xs on the explained variable, then we are going to have inaccurate estimates.</em></p>

<p>The estimates are accurate, this is not the problem. The problem with the standard interpretation of isolated effects is that we hold all other predictors fixed, which is strange if there are strong correlations to those other predictors. In our example it is even wrong to say ""the average $Y$ value increases by 1.3235 if we increase $X_1$ by 1 and hold $X_2$ fixed, because $X_2 = X_1^2$. Since we cannot interpret isolated effects descriptively, also all inductive statements about them are not useful: Look at the t-tests in the output. Both are above the 5% level, although the global test of association gives us a p-value below 5%. The null hypothesis of such a t-test is ""the effect of the predictor is zero"" or, in other words, ""the inclusion of this predictor does not increase the true R-squared in the population"". Because $X_1$ and $X_2$ are almost perfectly correlated, the model has almost the same R-squared if we drop one of the two variables:</p>

<pre><code>summary(lm(Y~X1))

58300,23073.0,1,,,,Confidence Intervals Intuition,<confidence-interval>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I am new to statistics and have run into some trouble understanding computing confidence intervals and am seeking some help. I will outline the motivating example in my textbook and hopefully someone can offer some guidance. </p>

<p>Example </p>

<p>There is a population of mean values and your goal is to figure out the true mean (as best you can). In order to accomplish this, a number of samples are taken, each of which has a mean value. </p>

<p>Next, because we know by the central limit theorem that as the number of samples increase, the sampling distribution will be normally distributed, we use the equation $z = \frac{X - \bar{X}}{s}$  (noting that in this case s = standard error) to compute a lower and upper bound taking each sample mean as the mean for the z-score equation and z-scores of -1.96 and +1.96, for example,  to compute a 95% confidence interval. </p>

<p>So I do not understand how it is you can use each sample mean as the mean value in our z equation to compute intervals. We know that the sample distribution is normally distributed so isn’t it the case that only the mean of all the samples can be used? How can we compute an interval around each mean value that contributes to the sampling distribution?</p>

58301,2081.0,2,,58296.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>There exist a number of frequenly mentioned regressional effects which conceptually are different but share much in common when seen purely statistically (see e.g. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819361/pdf/nihms-173346.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this paper</a> &quot;Equivalence of the Mediation, Confounding and Suppression
Effect&quot; by David MacKinnon et al., or Wikipedia articles):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mediator: IV which conveys effect (totally of partly) of another IV
to the DV.</li>
<li>Confounder: IV which constitutes or precludes, totally or
partly, effect of another IV to the DV.</li>
<li>Moderator: IV which, varying,
manages the strength of the effect of another IV on the DV.
Statistically, it is known as interaction between the two IVs.</li>
<li>Suppressor: IV (a mediator or a moderator conceptually) which inclusion
strengthens the effect of another IV on the DV.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not going to discuss to what extent some or all of them are technically similar (for that, read the paper linked above). My aim is to try to show graphically what <strong>suppressor</strong> is. The above definition that &quot;suppressor is a variable which inclusion strengthens the effect of another IV on the DV&quot; seems to me <em>potentially</em> broad because it does not tell anything about mechanisms of such enhancement. Below I'm discussing one mechanism - the only one I consider to be suppression. If there are <em>other</em> mechanisms as well (as for right now, I haven't tried to meditate of any such other) then either the above &quot;broad&quot; definition should be considered imprecise or my definition of suppression should be considered too narrow.</p>
<h3>Definition (in my understanding)</h3>
<p>Suppressor is the independent variable which, when added to the model, raises observed R-square <strong>mostly due to its accounting for the residuals</strong> left by the model without it, and not due to its own association with the DV (which is comparatively weak). We know that the increase in R-square in response to adding a IV is the squared part correlation of that IV in that new model. This way, if the part correlation of the IV with the DV <strong>is greater</strong> (by absolute value) than the zero-order <span class=""math-container"">$r$</span> between them, that IV is a suppressor.</p>
<p>So, a suppressor mostly &quot;suppresses&quot; the error of the reduced model, being weak as a predictor itself. The error term is the complement to the prediction. The prediction is &quot;projected on&quot; or &quot;shared between&quot; the IVs (regression coefficients), and so is the error term (&quot;complements&quot; to the coefficients). The suppressor suppresses such error components unevenly: greater for some IVs, lesser for other IVs. For those IVs &quot;whose&quot; such components it suppresses greatly it lends considerable facilitating aid by actually <strong>raising their regression coefficients</strong>.</p>
<p>Not strong suppressing effects occurs often and wildly (an <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/35091/3277"">example</a> on this site). Strong suppression is typically introduced consciously. A researcher seeks for a characteristic which must correlate with the DV as weak as possible and at the same time would correlate with something in the IV of interest which is considered irrelevant, prediction-void, in respect to the DV. He enters it to the model and gets considerable increase in that IV's predictive power. The suppressor's coefficient is typically not interpreted.</p>
<p>I could summarize my <strong>definition</strong> as follows [up on @Jake's answer and @gung's comments]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formal (statistical) definition: suppressor is IV with part
correlation larger than zero-order correlation (with the dependent).</li>
<li>Conceptual (practical) definition: the above formal definition + the zero-order
correlation is small, so that the suppressor is not a sound predictor
itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Suppessor&quot; is a role of a IV in a specific <em>model</em> only, not the characteristic of the separate variable. When other IVs are added or removed, the suppressor can suddenly stop suppressing or resume suppressing or change the focus of its suppressing activity.</p>
<h3>Normal regression situation</h3>
<p>The first picture below shows a typical regression with two predictors (we'll speak of linear regression). The picture is copied from <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/65817/3277"">here</a> where it is explained in more details. In short, moderately correlated (= having acute angle between them) predictors <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> span 2-dimesional space &quot;plane X&quot;. The dependent variable <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> is projected onto it orthogonally, leaving the predicted variable <span class=""math-container"">$Y'$</span> and the residuals with st. deviation equal to the length of <span class=""math-container"">$e$</span>. R-square of the regression is the angle between <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$Y'$</span>, and the two regression coefficients are directly related to the skew coordinates <span class=""math-container"">$b_1$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$b_2$</span>, respectively. This situation I've called normal or typical because both <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> correlate with <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> (oblique angle exists between each of the independents and the dependent) and the predictors compete for the prediction because they are correlated.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jI8z6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<h3>Suppression situation</h3>
<p>It is shown on the next picture. This one is like the previous; however <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> vector now directs somewhat away from the viewer and <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> changed its direction considerably. <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> acts as a suppressor. Note first of all that it hardly correlates with <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span>. Hence it cannot be a valuable <em>predictor</em> itself. Second. Imagine <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> is absent and you predict only by <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span>; the prediction of this one-variable regression is depicted as <span class=""math-container"">$Y^*$</span> red vector, the error as <span class=""math-container"">$e^*$</span> vector, and the coefficient is given by <span class=""math-container"">$b^*$</span> coordinate (which is the endpoint of <span class=""math-container"">$Y^*$</span>).</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3eMTT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<p>Now bring yourself back to the full model and notice that <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> is fairly correlated with <span class=""math-container"">$e^*$</span>. Thus, <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> when introduced in the model, can explain a considerable portion of that error of the reduced model, cutting down <span class=""math-container"">$e^*$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$e$</span>. This constellation: (1) <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> is not a rival to <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span> as a <em>predictor</em>; and (2) <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> is a dustman to pick up <em>unpredictedness</em> left by <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span>, - makes <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> a <strong>suppressor</strong>. As a result of its effect, predictive strength of <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span> has grown to some extent: <span class=""math-container"">$b_1$</span> is larger than <span class=""math-container"">$b^*$</span>.</p>
<p>Well, why is <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> called a suppressor to <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span> and how can it reinforce it when &quot;suppressing&quot; it? Look at the next picture.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XisTU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<p>It is exactly the same as the previous. Think again of the model with the single predictor <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span>. This predictor could of course be decomposed in two parts or components (shown in grey): the part which is &quot;responsible&quot; for prediction of <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> (and thus coinciding with that vector) and the part which is &quot;responsible&quot; for the unpredictedness (and thus parallel to <span class=""math-container"">$e^*$</span>). It is <strong>this</strong> second part of <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span> - the part irrelevant to <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> - is suppressed by <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> when that suppressor is added to the model. The irrelevant part is suppressed and thus, given that the suppressor doesn't itself predict <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> any much, the relevant part looks stronger. A suppressor is not a predictor but rather a facilitator for another/other predictor/s. Because it competes with what impedes them to predict.</p>
<h3>Sign of the suppressor's regression coefficient</h3>
<p>It is the sign of the correlation between the suppressor and the error variable <span class=""math-container"">$e^*$</span> left by the reduced (without-the-suppressor) model. In the depiction above, it is positive. In other settings (for example, revert the direction of <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span>) it could be negative.</p>

<p>Observe that <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span> served as suppressor. Its zero-order correlation with <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> is practically zero but its part correlation is much larger by magnitude, <span class=""math-container"">$-.224$</span>. It strengthened to some extent the predictive force of <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span> (from r <span class=""math-container"">$.419$</span>, a would-be beta in simple regression with it, to beta <span class=""math-container"">$.538$</span> in the multiple regression).</p>
<p>According to the <em>formal</em> definition, <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span> appeared a suppressor too, because its part correlation is greater than its zero-order correlation. But that is because we have only two IV in the simple example. Conceptually, <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span> isn't a suppressor because its <span class=""math-container"">$r$</span> with <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> is not about <span class=""math-container"">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>By way, sum of squared part correlations exceeded R-square: <code>.4750^2+(-.2241)^2 = .2758 &gt; .2256</code>, which would not occur in normal regressional situation (see the <strong>Venn diagram</strong> below).</p>
<h3>Suppression and coefficient's sign change</h3>
<p>Adding a variable that will serve a supressor may as well as may not change the sign of some other variables' coefficients. &quot;Suppression&quot; and &quot;change sign&quot; effects are not the same thing. Moreover, I believe that a suppressor can never change sign of <em>those</em> predictors whom they serve suppressor. (It would be a shocking discovery to add the suppressor on purpose to facilitate a variable and then to find it having become indeed stronger but in the opposite direction! I'd be thankful if somebody could show me it is possible.)</p>
<h3>Suppression and coefficient strengthening</h3>
<p>To cite an earlier passage: &quot;For those IVs &quot;whose&quot; such components [error components] it suppresses greatly the suppressor lends considerable facilitating aid by actually <strong>raising their regression coefficients</strong>&quot;. Indeed, in our Example above, <span class=""math-container"">$X_2$</span>, the suppressor, raised the coefficient for <span class=""math-container"">$X_1$</span>. Such enhancement of the unique predictive power of another regressor is often the <em>aim</em> of a suppressor to a model but it is not the <em>definition</em> of suppressor or of suppression effect. For, the aforementioned enhancement of another predictor's capacity via adding more regressors can easily occure in a normal regressional situation without those regressors being suppressors. Here is an example.</p>

Still, we find no suppressor in the model. <span class=""math-container"">$X_3$</span>'s part correlation (<span class=""math-container"">$.229$</span>) is not greater than its zero-order correlation (<span class=""math-container"">$.427$</span>). Same is for the other regressors. &quot;Facilitation&quot; effect was there, but not due to &quot;suppression&quot; effect. Definition of a suppessor is different from just strenghtening/facilitation; and it is about picking up mostly errors, due to which the part correlation exceeds the zero-order one.</p>

For my thesis I have to show how ""well"" did my approach improve things. </p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong>: Every year we use a tool A to brainstorm and negotiate software requirements. The tool was wiki-based and had very low participation from technical and non-technical (client) stakeholders. (Yes we have real living and breathing clients for our class :). I looked at the state of affairs and saw that perhaps social networking based/influenced technologies could help increase participation. So I created tool B to replace tool A. However, tool A was used for the first 2 years and tool B for the latter 3 years. </p>

<p><strong>Environment</strong>: The students changed every year but the overall composition of the class was relatively same (i.e., we had the similar amount of awesome, average and underperforming teams/students). We strive for selecting client projects which are similar level of difficulty and are doable in the duration of the class. They can all be considered projects of the same 'class' (class as in category - same level of complexity etc).</p>

<p>Here's my <strong>hypothesis</strong>: Tool B will increase stakeholder participation as compared to Tool A (it was initially in past tense, then changed to present and now to future. Not sure what's right. Keep getting corrections for tense from advisors.)</p>

<p>Here are my <strong>measurements</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client (non-technical) participation using Tool B vs Tool A - via access logs</li>
<li>Team (student) participation using Tool B vs Tool A - via access logs + observational data</li>
<li>Number of requirements captured/negotiated (new/updated) in Tool A vs Tool B</li>
<li>Client surveys (for ascertaining the usefulness of tool A for capturing/negotiating requirements. Already have for Tool B.)</li>
</ol>

<p>One of my advisors suggests I use MANCOVA with 1-3 above as DVs and covariates capturing ""sense of complexity of projects"", ""average number of use-cases per project"" and ""some metric for team composition/makeup"" (which are pretty much the same across the years). Another advisor thinks that simple t-tests would work just fine: That is, I compare the average performance of groups across the years (Group 1 = Tool A; Group 2 = Tool B) and it should be sufficient or maybe an ANOVA at most. Another advior says not to do anything since the data itself is highly skewed i.e., using Tool B has really increased each of the above! He said that doing a statistical test is only to increase the perceived success of the tool and just makes a pompous show of the rigor in analysis.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure what would be a good approach here? I'm familiar with t-tests but have never done a MANCOVA ever and am afraid that I may just crunch the numbers and falsify underlying assumptions. What would be an appropriate test for such an experimental design, which is done across multiple years, with different groups, keeping the environment relatively constant? I have many such hypotheses w.r.t. tool B since there are many things that it enables from a process standpoint than what was doable before. It's really confusing with 3 advisors giving different advice and I not being a statistician to be able to decide.</p>

How can I sample from the posterior distribution with such a restriction. Is there any specific method?</p>

<p>After seeing the answers I've decided to write my exact question to clarify stuff:
Its about learning hyper-parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and parameters $\theta_i$ in the following case:</p>

<p>$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are uniformly chosen from the perimeter of a square by following vertices: $(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)$. Now $\theta_i$ is uniformly chosen from this line. $\theta_i$ it self is the parameter for data $y_i\sim\text{Bin}(n_i,\theta_i)$.</p>

<p>In my first attempt, and maybe being foolish I wrote a neat vectored algorithm which would sample from $p(\alpha,\beta,\theta)$ where $\theta=(\theta_1,\theta_2,...)$. But afterwards I realised that it is hardly related to sampling from $p(y|\alpha,\beta,\theta)$ maybe as a result of the answers here.</p>

<p>So what I am doing now is that I ignored the whole sampling algorithm I had for the joint priors. To solve the problem is to make a MC random-walk on parameter space $(\alpha,\beta)$ and sub-sampling from it (according to discussion on <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/73885/mcmc-on-a-bounded-parameter-space?noredirect=1#comment143867_73885"">another question of mine</a> in each step), then sampling from $p(\theta|\alpha,\beta)$ and then calculating the likelihood and then test the new sample according to Metropolis Hasting! I am not even sure this is correct but after my studies, this is the what I can think of!</p>

<p>But first things first. If your hypothesis is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tool B will increase stakeholder participation as compared to Tool A.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stick with it. That's probably the most straightforward and honest thing to measure (honest, in my opinion, since you don't use any covariates such as ""sense of complexity of projects"" that are unreliable in terms of how well can you measure that etc.). As you correctly pointed out, and so did Prof. 2, a two sample t-test is the right tool to measure mean differences between two groups.</p>

<p>However, then you seem to be wanting to analyze other four things you are measuring, out of which three weren't measured for both tools according to your description: 1:B, 2:B, 3:{A,B}, 4:A. Statistically, I don't see how you want to determine differences between groups for anything other than measurement 3. Which leaves you with a t-test again.</p>

<p>Your main problem is that a t-test will allow you to say that there is a significant difference. You always need a controlled experiment to claim causality, which in your case is tricky, as you didn't deploy both tools simultaneously using a control group, but rather you first test one, than the other. The obvious problem with this approach is that in the meantime, the usage pattern might have changed due to a number of factors so diverse such as better smartphones, more savvy users, you don't know. </p>

<ul>
<li>But I would still claim that what you have is more than observational
data.  </li>
<li>I would roll with a t-test for the things measured for both
tools.  </li>
<li>I would avoid metrics such as ""perceived complexity of XY"". </li>
<li>If the densities of the ""Number of requirements"" of A and B are
visibly different, plot them.</li>

<p>You can also run <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test"" rel=""nofollow"">one</a> of the plethora of tests for testing whether your two empirical distributions are the same. (I agree with Prof. 3 that if you can clearly see a different distribution shape, centered around a different value, formal tests are a bit of a showmanship, but he is a professor and can get away with saying that, you probably won't).</p>

There are eight separate drought index values per year, every year, for each drought index, and only one value per year for the corn yield data.

58315,633.0,2,,58314.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>It seems you might be asking why spreading discrete data has no effect on entropy.  Because entropy is a measure of expected surprise, the various labels or values that a thing can take is immaterial.  So, the discrete values $x_i$ don't matter, merely their masses and spreading the $x_i$s has no effect.</p>

<p>In the continuous case, spreading things out by scaling inevitably reduces the densities, which affects the entropy as defined in your question.  The definition is consistent with our intuition of entropy, Shannon explains, because we typically compare two entropies, and since both are scaled, this effect cancels out.  Differential entropy is also consistent with discrete entropy in the sense that it approximates what would happen if the entropy of the quantized distribution were measured.</p>

<p>Note that in the continuous case, spreading things out by other methods can leave entropy unchanged.  For example, a uniform distribution over $[-\frac12,\frac12]$ has entropy zero.  ""Spreading it out"" so that it is uniform over $[-10, -9.5], [9.5,10]$ still has entropy zero.  Spreading never matters; only the expected surprisal does.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is one important difference between the continuous and discrete
  entropies. In the discrete case the entropy measures in an absolute
  way the randomness of the chance variable. In the continuous case the
  measurement is relative to the coordinate system [and] the entropy can
  be considered a measure of randomness relative to an assumed standard,
  namely the coordinate system chosen with each small volume element $dx_1, …, dx_n$
  given equal weight. When we change the coordinate system to
  $y_1, …, y_n$, the entropy in the new system measures the randomness
  when equal volume elements $dx_1, …, dx_n$ in the new system are given
  equal weight.</p>
  
  <p>In spite of this dependence on the coordinate system the
  entropy concept is as important in the continuous case as the discrete
  case. This is due to the fact that the derived concepts of information
  rate and channel capacity depend on the difference of two entropies
  and this difference does not depend on the coordinate frame, each of
  the two terms being changed by the same amount.</p>
  
  <p>The entropy of a
  continuous distribution can be negative. The scale of measurements
  sets an arbitrary zero corresponding to a uniform distribution over a
  unit volume. A distribution which is more confined than this has less
  entropy and will be negative. The rates and capacities will, however,
  always be nonnegative.

58319,5448.0,2,,58308.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>You have several nice, more-or-less simple, options.  Your uniform prior helps make them simpler.</p>
<p>Option 1: Independence sampler.  You can just set your proposal distribution equal to a uniform distribution over the unit square, which ensures that samples won't fall outside the restricted zone, as you call it.  Potential downside: if the posterior is concentrated in a very small region of the unit square, you may have a very low acceptance rate.  OTOH, it's hard to generate random numbers faster than from a U(0,1) distribution.  Potential upside: less work for you.</p>
<p>Option 2: Transform your parameters to something that isn't bounded, make proposals for the transformed parameters, then transform the parameters back for use in the likelihood functions.  Note that in this case the prior is going to be on the transformed parameters, because that's what you're making proposals for, so you'll have to mess with the Jacobian of the transform to get the new prior.  For your analysis, of course, you'll transform the MCMC-generated parameter random numbers back to the original parameters.  Potential downside: more initial work for you.  Potential upside: better acceptance rate for your proposals.</p>
<p>Option 3: Construct a proposal distribution other than an independence sampler that is on the unit square.  This allows you to keep your uniform prior, but at the cost of greater complexity when calculating the proposal probabilities.  An example of this, letting <span class=""math-container"">$x$</span> be the current value of one of your parameters, would be a Beta distribution with parameters <span class=""math-container"">$(nx, n(1-x))$</span>.  The larger <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> is, the more concentrated your proposal will be around the current value.  Potential downside: more initial work for you.  Potential upside: better acceptance rate for your proposals - but if you make <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> too large, and move near to a corner, you might wind up making lots of small moves in the corner before getting out.</p>
<p>Option 4: Just reject any proposals that fall outside the unit square (Xian's half-hearted suggestion).  Note that this is not the same as just generating another proposal; in this case you are rejecting the proposal, which means your next value for the parameter is the same as the current value for the parameter. This works because it's what would happen if you had a zero prior probability for some region of your parameter space and generated a random number that fell in that region.  Potential downside: if you get near a corner, you may have a low acceptance probability and get stuck for a while.  Potential upside: less work for you.</p>
<p>Option 5: Create an extended problem on the plane which, on the unit square, is the same as the actual problem you face, do everything right, then, when post-processing the results of the MCMC sampling, throw out all the samples outside of the unit square.  Potential upside:  If it's very easy to create that extended problem, it may be less work for you.  Potential downside: if the Markov chain wanders off somewhere outside the unit square for a while, you may have, in effect, horrible acceptance probabilities, as you will throw out most of your samples.</p>
<p>No doubt there are other options, I'd be interested to see what other people suggest!</p>
<p>The difference between 2 and 3 is to some extent conceptual, although with real implications for what you actually do.  I'd probably go with 3, as I'd just let R  tell me what the proposal probabilities are (if I'm programming in R) and the amount of extra effort, aside from some tuning of the proposal distribution parameter <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span>, looks small to me.  If I was using JAGS or BUGS, of course, that would be a whole different matter, since those tools handle their own proposals.</p>

I will try to explain myself as clearly as possible... Wish me luck!</p>

<p>I have a sequence of (<em>a priori</em>) probabilities of a binary variable, we could say $X_i \sim Ber(p_i)$, i.e. $P(X_i = 1) = 1 - P(X_i = 0)=p_i$. I know that $X_i$ are not independent, but I don't know exactly $P(X_i|X_{j\neq i})$ nor $P(X_i|X_{j_1\neq i},...,X_{j_n\neq i})$ (I don't know anything about their dependence), and I want to know $$P(\sum_{j=-K}^{j=K} X_{i+j} =0)$$
What kind of knowledge/hypothesis do you think I need in order to approximate this more efficiently? Assuming that they are independent does not work well enough. What would you do if you found a similar situation? I am not an expert at all in this matters, and the more I learn about statistics the less I know! </p>

<p>For example, I can see that the probabilities form small ""triangle"" shapes, so maybe something like $P(X_i = 1 | X_{i-1} = 1, X_{i-2} = 0) = P(X_i = 0 | X_{i-1} = 0, X_{i-2} = 1) $ can help? If so, is there any way to use this? As I said, I have no idea...</p>

<p>edit: I think the title is not very good, but I don't know how to explain it better... One more question, can I say $Y_i = X_i - X_{i-1}$ and try to see $P(X_i|Y_{i-1})$?</p>

Although it is only useful for my particular problem, maybe somebody can tell me if I am being too ""sloppy"", correct me or maybe my approach might be useful to somebody in the future.</p>

<p>First of all, I had not realized that the ""triangles"" account for ""long  independent events"". This means that $P(X_i = 0 | \sum_{j\neq i, |j-i| &lt; D} X_j = 1) = 1$ in my notation ($X_i$ represents that an event starts in the moment $i$). What I started doing was a smoothing of $2D$ of $p_i$, so I took the average (can I do this?) in windows. This gave me a way of seeing how many events are there in a sequence.

<p>The orange line is the original $p_i$ sequence, the black one is the smoothed. After this, in a window of length $2K$, I count how many peaks are there (how many possible events), and the probability of each event is the sum of probabilities from the beginning until the end of the ""hill"", although, as can be seen in the picture, sometimes they can overlap, but I have no idea of how can I take that into account. Then, the probability of no event happening in the window of length $2K$ is the product of probabilities of no ""long event"" happening in this window.</p>

58351,503.0,2,,52126.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>First, we'll need to know whether you are interested in the response to each Likert question or to a sum of Likert questions; if the latter, it matters how many questions and what the distribution of the scale looks like.</p>

<p>Either way, you will have to account for the nonindependence of the data, because the same people are answering the questions multiple times. Repeated measures ANOVA is one solution to this, but it makes unrealistic assumptions including sphericity, and would only be usable for the scale score, and only if the scores ranged fairly widely so that you could pretend they were continuous.</p>

<p>A better option is a mixed model. If you treat the scores as continuous data, then this would be a linear mixed model; if you treat them as ordinal (as you would have to do if you were interested in each question) then you would need a nonlinear mixed model.</p>

Is there a formal and valid way to combine them into a single formula?</p>

<p>I have read about mixture distributions, are they applicable to my case?</p>

<p>Suppose that my models can be more or less reliable, depending on the source of information they are based on, can I also combine them giving more weight to one model rather than another?</p>

<p>One possible solution I have thought is to make a weighted average of all the PDFs: $p(x) = w_1*p_1(x) + ... + w_N * p_N(x)$ where $\sum\limits_{i=0}^N w_i = 1$, does it make sense?</p>

<p>Thanks very much for your suggestions!</p>

<p>PS: to be more concrete my models give me the probability distribution that a certain person is in the position (x,y) and they rely on different sources of information like the power of a received signal or some other observable fact.</p>

<p>Kernel methods provide a structured way to use a linear algorithm in a transformed feature space, for which the transformation is typically nonlinear (and to a higher dimensional space). The key advantage this so-called kernel trick brings is that nonlinear patterns can be found at a <em>reasonable</em> computational cost. </p>

<p>Note that I said the computational cost is reasonable, but not negligible. Kernel methods typically construct a kernel matrix $\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ with $N$ the number of training instances. The complexity of kernel methods is therefore a function of the number of training instances, rather than the number of input dimensions. Support vector machines, for example, have a training complexity between $O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$. For problems with very large $N$, this complexity is currently prohibitive. </p>

<p>This makes kernel methods very interesting from a computational perspective when the number of dimensions is large and the number of samples is relatively low (say, less than 1 million).</p>

<h2>SVM for Large Scale Problems</h2>

<p>For <em>very</em> high dimensional problems, such as the <code>10000</code> dimensions you mention in the question, there is often no need to map to a higher dimensional feature space. The input space is already good enough. For such problems, linear methods are <em>orders of magnitude</em> faster with almost the same predictive performance. Examples of these methods can be found in <a href=""http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/"" rel=""noreferrer"">LIBLINEAR</a> or <a href=""http://hunch.net/~vw/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vowpal Wabbit</a>. </p>

<p>Linear methods are particularly interesting when you have many samples in a high dimensional input space. When you have only $500$ samples, using a nonlinear kernel method will also be cheap (since $N$ is small). If you had, say, $5.000.000$ samples in $10.000$ dimensions, kernel methods would be infeasible.</p>

<p>For low-dimensional problems with many training instances (so-called large $N$ small $p$ problems), linear methods may yield poor predictive accuracy. For such problems, ensemble methods such as <a href=""http://esat.kuleuven.be/sista/ensemblesvm"" rel=""noreferrer"">EnsembleSVM</a> provide nonlinear decision boundaries at significantly reduced computational cost compared to standard SVM.</p>

Generally speaking, given a set of $N$ models, you choose your weights to correspond to the posterior probability of each model.
$$ p(M_i | D) \propto p(M_i)p(D | M_i) $$
where $p(M_i)$ is the prior of model importance, you can assume this to be uniform, and $D$ is your data. Hence $p(D | M_i)$ is simply the likelihood of model $i$ given data.</p>

<p>The predictive probability for a new value $y^*$ and explanatory values $\mathbf{x}$ is then:
$$ p(y^* | \mathbf{x}, D) = \sum_{i=1}^N p(y^*|\mathbf{x},D,M_i)p(M_i | D)$$
where we use the posteriors as weighting between models.</p>

<p>That's the theory. Now in practice, unless you happen to be dealing with conjugated probabilities, you won't get a closed form solution for those posteriors and the above is pretty much useless.</p>

<p>When people fit a mixture of distributions, they usually use a mixture of Gaussians and in rare occasions a mixture of t distributions. I think the reason is simply that the mixture is fit using the EM algorithm (again, see Bishop) and Gaussians are particularly useful since their posterior is again a Gaussian and you can get all the required updates for the EM algorithm in closed form solution. And when I say ""fit"", they don't fit them individually, but learn the best parameters for all mixture components from the data, which is not what you are doing.</p>

<p>Don't worry about that for now and simply check whether you can get the posteriors for your model, or whether you don't want to fit your mixture using the EM and some well known distribution, such as the Gaussian, or t distribution in case of many outliers.</p>

<p>EDIT (to your comment):</p>

<p>So first of all, my notation: $y$ is the quantity you are trying to model, $x$ is a vector of data used to model $y$.</p>

<p>The data $D$ is just a tuple of vectors $x$, used to model a tuple of $y$'s. (basically think any normal dataset with a dependent variable and multiple independent ones)</p>

<p>OK. now, if I understand correctly you are trying to fit a complex distribution and you somehow already know the models that explain the data (perhaps because you know the generating mechanism) so you only need the mixing proportions.</p>

<p>You could try the following, which is guaranteed to work for Gaussians, and I don't see why it shouldn't work for other distributions too. (though there is a big caveat here!)</p>

<p>Calculate for each point x the likelihood that the point was generated by model $f1$ and $f2$, where the parameters are known. You end up with a matrix of likelihoods $2 x N$ where N is the number of your points. sum each row and divide by N. You should get the responsibility of each of the models for generating the data.</p>

<p>Use that to weight your mixture. You should also check if the resulting density integrates to 1, and if not normalize appropriately.</p>

In other words, the expected value is 0.02. However, the observed value is 6 faults in 100 meters, or 0.06 faults/meter. So,</p>

<ol>
<li>$H_0 : \lambda = 0.02 $ </li>
<li>$H_1 : \lambda \gt 0.02 $</li>

<p>You can also write the alternative as $\lambda \ne 0.02$. </p>

<p>In the second question, the rejection criteria depends on what level of $ \alpha $ you choose. It also depends on which of the two alternative hypotheses you chose. Since the observed value is greater, it is natural to chose greater than, not equal to. Assume a 5% type-1 error. Then, the sum of iid poissons variables is a new poisson random variable.

<p>You are still testing if $ \lambda = 0.02 $, but indirectly by calculating if the new poisson variable $ \lambda' = 100\lambda $. Since this will be a one-tailed distribution, you still want P[X>=5] if it is less than 5%, not 2*P, which corresponds to the two-tailed test</p>

<p>This is equal to saying, the Likelihood of a parameter needs to become 0 at the boundary of the parameter space in order for the result to be valid.</p>

<p>Well first of all, you can restrict the parameter space to values that all have a positive likelihood and still obtain a valid estimate.</p>

<p>Secondly, even if you use, say $(-\infty,\infty)$, you don't come close to the boundary since any off the shelf optimisation package performs some sort of random initialisation and then approaches the minimum using some method such as gradient descent, conjugate gradient or another.

<p>In the physics literature the Ising model is cannonically defined as
$$
H(Y)=- \sum_{&lt;ij&gt;} J_{ij} y_i y_j

the sum is over all pairs of interacting sites, $Y$ is my notation for the entire state of the sites (i.e. a given $Y$ specifies $y_i$ for all $i$).  Note the minus sign.  One might be inclined to write $H(Y)=\vec{y}^T W \vec{y}$</p>

<p>The partition function is given by $Z=\sum_{Y} e^{-\beta H(Y)}$; yet another minus sign.</p>

<p>The probability that you'll see the physical system in the state $Y$  is given by
$$ 
P(Y) = \frac{ e^{-\beta H(Y)}}{Z} = \frac{ e^{\beta \sum_{&lt;ij&gt;} J_{ij} y_i y_j} } {Z} = \frac{e^{-\beta  \vec{y}^T W \vec{y}}}{Z}

<p>I left $\beta=1/k_BT$ in these expressions since these are the expressions typically written by physicists, but in this problem, one can just absorb it into the definition of the $J_{ij}$ (or equivalently set $\beta=1$).</p>

<p>The main point is that when dealing with statistical mechanics physicists are use to dealing with ""energies"" which have the property that lower (more negative) energy states are more likely to be occupied.  This is in the opposite sense from log-likelihoods (higher log-likelihoods are associated with more probable outcomes), and can lead to confusion when one tries to switch back and forth between these two conceptions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>in ANOVA, for testing equality of means (and various similar analyses); and</p></li>
<li><p>in testing equality of variances</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let's consider each in turn:</p>

<p>1) F tests in ANOVA (and similarly, the usual kinds of chi-square tests for count data) are constructed so that the more the data are consistent with the alternative hypothesis, the larger the test statistic tends to be, while arrangements of sample data that looks most consistent with the null corresponds to the smallest values of the test statistic.</p>

<p>Consider three samples (of size 10, with equal sample variance), and arrange them to have equal sample means, and then move their means around in different patterns. As the variation in the sample means increases from zero, the F statistic becomes larger:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0SI5a.png"" alt=""Arrangements of 3 samples and corresponding F statistic""></p>

<p>The black lines ($^{\:_|}$) are the data values. The heavy red lines ($\color{red}{\mathbf{|}}$) are the group means.</p>

<p>If the null hypothesis (equality of population means) were true, you'd expect some variation in sample means, and would typically expect to see F ratios roughly around 1. Smaller F statistics result from samples that are closer together than you'd typically expect ... so you aren't going to conclude the population means differ.</p>

<p>Let $y_t=\phi_1y_{t-1}+\phi_2y_{t-2}+\epsilon_t$, with $\epsilon_t\sim N(0,1)$.  Now, I want to plot the spectra of $y_t$ in the following cases:</p>

<p>Case 1: When the AR(2) characteristic polynomial has two real reciprocal roots given by $r_1=0.9$ and $r_2=-0.95.$</p>

<p>Case 2: When the AR(2) characteristic polynomial has a pair of complex reciprocal roots with modulus $r=0.95$ and frequency $2\pi/8$.</p>

<p>Now, before plotting the spectra of $y_t$ in the following cases, I have tried to make use of the following important facts.  The AR(2) process $y_t=\phi_1y_{t-1}+\phi_2y_{t-2}+\epsilon_t$ has the general linear process form $\psi(u)=1/(1-\phi_1u-\phi_2u^2)$ and hence
$$f(\omega)=\frac{v}{2\pi}|(1-\phi_1e^{-i\omega}-\phi_2e^{-2i\omega})|^{-2}$$
This can be expanded to give
$$f(\omega)=\frac{v}{2\pi[1+\phi^2_1+2\phi_2+\phi_2^2+2(\phi_1\phi_2-\phi_1)\cos(\omega)-4\phi_2\cos^2(\omega)]}$$
Now if the roots are real, then $f(\omega)$ has a mode at either zero or $\pi$; otherwise, the roots are complex conjugates and $f(\omega)$ is unimodal at $\omega=\arccos[-\phi_1(1-\phi_2)/4\phi_2]$ lying strictly between zero and $\pi$.</p>

<p>So if anyone could help explain to me how I am supposed to relate the above facts with the two different case that would be very helpful.  I guess what I am struggling with is what values to plug into $f(\omega)$.</p>

The former is about the belief vs frequency issue (illustrated in the second article). The later is illustrated in the first article. Both put together seem to me like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The frequentist interpretation of the frequentist approach ensures to
be right a% of the time for large number of trials assuming only the
likelihood distribution, no matter which parameter we get, as long we
as assume that we'll get a good range of data.</li>

right a% of the time for large number of trials assuming the
likelihood distribution and the prior, no matter which data we get,

<li>The bayesian interpretation of the frequentist approach says that we
are right with a probability of a% assuming only the likelihood
distribution, no matter which parameter we get, as long as we assume
fairness in the randomness of the data.</li>

58400,20473.0,2,,58395.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p><em>(Stationarity of what? What kind/level of stationarity?)</em>  </p>

<p>Given the standard linear regression specification (without <em>any</em> specific stochastic assumptions)</p>

<p>$$\mathbf y = \mathbf X\beta +\mathbf u $$
as a  matter of mathematics we have 
$$\hat\beta_{OLS} = \left(\mathbf X'\mathbf X\right)^{-1}\mathbf X'\mathbf y=\beta + \left(\mathbf X'\mathbf X\right)^{-1}\mathbf X'\mathbf u$$</p>

<p><strong>For consistency</strong> of  $\hat\beta_{OLS}$  we need (as sample size $n$ goes to infinity)
$$\operatorname {plim}\left [\left(\mathbf X'\mathbf X\right)^{-1}\mathbf X'\mathbf u \right ]= \mathbf 0 \Rightarrow \left(\operatorname {plim}\frac 1n\mathbf X'\mathbf X\right)^{-1} \operatorname {plim}\left (\frac 1n\mathbf X'\mathbf u \right )= \mathbf 0$$</p>

<p>This requires   </p>

<p>a) that $\left(\operatorname {plim}\frac 1n\mathbf X'\mathbf X\right)^{-1} &lt; \infty$, and that it converges to a positive definite matrix, which is a condition usually just assumed, and it will be satisfied if the ""Grenander conditions"" are satisfied (in short, as $n\rightarrow \infty$, no regressor degenerates to a sequence of zeros, no single observation dominates the sum of squares of its series, and the regressor matrix always has full rank). These conditions <em>exclude some kinds of</em> non-stationarity of the regressors, but they do not <em>require</em>  covariance-stationarity (which is the one usually meant under the term ""stationarity"").</p>

<p>b) that 
$$\operatorname {plim}\left (\frac 1n\mathbf X'\mathbf u \right )= \mathbf 0\Rightarrow \left [\begin{matrix}
\operatorname {plim}\frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^nx_{1i}u_i \\
...\\
\operatorname {plim}\frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^nx_{ki}u_i
\end{matrix}\right ] =\mathbf 0 $$</p>

<p>Now <em>Markov's</em> Law of Large Numbers, in order to hold  requires that 
$$\frac 1{n^2}\operatorname {Var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^nx_{1i}u_i\right)\rightarrow 0,\; \text {as}\; n\rightarrow \infty$$</p>

<p>Here too, this condition excludes some kinds of non-stationarity, but it does not require covariance stationarity (for example, both the mean and the variance of each $x_{ji}$ and each $u_i$ may be different -we only need that the variance of the sum is of smaller order than $n^2$).
If this condition holds then the Law of Large Numbers applies and we have (abusing notation a bit)</p>

<p>$$\operatorname {plim}\left (\frac 1n\mathbf X'\mathbf u \right )=  \left [\begin{matrix}
\operatorname {lim}\frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^nE(x_{1i}u_i) \\
...\\
\operatorname {lim}\frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^nE(x_{ki}u_i)
\end{matrix}\right ]$$</p>

<p>For this to be equal to the zero-vector we need that each regressor is <em>contemporaneously uncorrelated</em> with the error term, $E(x_{ji}u_i)=0,\; \forall j,i$. This is a condition related to stochastic dependence/independence, and has nothing to do with stationarity.</p>

<p><strong>For asymptotic normality</strong> of  $\hat\beta_{OLS}$ we examine</p>

<p>$$\operatorname {plim}\sqrt n(\hat\beta_{OLS} -\beta)= \operatorname {plim}\left[\sqrt n\left(\frac 1n \mathbf X'\mathbf X\right)^{-1}\frac 1n\mathbf X'\mathbf u\right] = \left(\operatorname {plim}\frac 1n\mathbf X'\mathbf X\right)^{-1} \operatorname {plim}\left (\frac 1{\sqrt n}\mathbf X'\mathbf u \right )$$</p>

<p>The first plim was discussed previously. For the <em>Lindeberg-Feller</em> Central Limit Theorem to hold for the second plim, what is required is<br>
a) that each regressor series is comprised of independent r.v.'s,<br>
b) that the errors are independent from each other,<br>
(both these can be relaxed)<br>
c) that the expected values and the variances of the rv's involved are finite, but <em>not necessarily equal</em><br>
d)and finally that ""no term dominates the whole"", which is expressed as a condition on the <em>relative</em> magnitude of the variances involved.  </p>

<p>So again, some forms of non-stationarity are excluded, but covariance-stationarity is not needed.</p>

58406,594.0,2,,44635.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>As with many such situations, one must take care to avoid confusing sample and population quantities.  (Given some particular distributional assumptions, we might choose to test for symmetry about a population mean using a statistic based on sample medians for example.)</p>
<p>We should also keep in mind that failure to reject a null of symmetry is not the same as showing symmetry.</p>
<p>Let's begin by simplifying things by assuming continuity.</p>
<p>First, what is meant by symmetry of a distribution? While it's usually conceived in the elementary treatments in terms of the density - i.e. as <span class=""math-container"">$f(\theta+x)=f(\theta-x)$</span>, when we say 'that the <em>distribution</em> is symmetric', I often tend to conceive it in terms of the distribution function (though the distinction won't matter, generally).</p>
<p>Note that symmetry around the population mean implies symmetry about the population median, so we needn't distinguish them - if the mean exists, the two will be the same.</p>
<p>There are two cases to distinguish:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>testing for symmetry about a specified location and</p>
</li>
<li><p>testing for symmetry about an unspecified location</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's consider each in turn</p>
<ol>
<li>One example of a way to test for symmetry about a specified mean <span class=""math-container"">$\theta_0$</span> is to create a second sample, <span class=""math-container"">$Y=2\theta_0-X$</span> and compute a test statistic that measures discrepancy in the  distributions of X and Y (such as a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic).</li>
</ol>
<p>[I'm not certain the distribution of the test statistic under the null is still the same as for the KS test <span class=""math-container"">$-$</span> and I'm not going to try to work it out right now <span class=""math-container"">$-$</span> but the distribution could easily be simulated for this circumstance, so it's not a huge issue.]</p>
<p>Note further that testing for symmetry about a known location may be reduced to testing for symmetry about 0 simply by subtracting the given location from all the observations. The test mentioned above would then be a test for symmetry about 0.</p>
<p>There are many other tests that could be used in this situation, such as a sign test (if the distribution is not symmetric about 0, there will typically tend to be an excess or deficit of positive signs, though counterexamples are certainly possible), or the signed rank test mentioned before. (They all act as a test of symmetry about the specified population mean)</p>

<p>If  2 time-series are cointegrated, i.e. there is a linear relation between them $$y_t = a + b x_t + \varepsilon_t$$ with stationary $\varepsilon_t$ it <em>implies</em> a linear relation between their differences $$\Delta y_t = b \Delta x_t + \Delta \varepsilon_t.$$ So if series are cointegrated, their differences should be correlated.

And I assume that if I don't see correlation between differenced series there is no cointegration either - it suffices to check only correlations.</p>

58416,23126.0,2,,10008.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>There are various processes in nature that involve only an interaction effect and laws that decribe them. For instance Ohm's law. In psychology you have for instance the performance model of Vroom (1964): Performance = Ability x Motivation.Now, you might expect finding an significant interaction effect when this law is true. Regretfully, this is not the case. You might easily end up with finding two main effects and an insignificant interaction effect (for a demonstration and further explanation see Landsheer, van den Wittenboer and Maassen (2006), Social Science Research 35, 274-294). The linear model is not very well suited for detecting interaction effects; Ohm might never have found his law when he had used linear models.</p>

<p>As a result, interpreting interaction effects in linear models is difficult. If you have a theory that predicts an interaction effect, you should include it even when insignificant. You may want to ignore main effects if your theory excludes those, but you will find that difficult, as significant main effects are often found in the case of a true data generating mechanism that has only a multiplicative effect. </p>

<p>My answer is: Yes, it can be valid to include a two-way interaction in a model without including the main effects. Linear models are excellent tools to approximate the outcomes of a large variety of data generating mechanisms, but their formula's can not be easily interpreted as a valid description of the data generating mechanism.</p>

Your response would be Tobs(e,c) and your factors of interest would be Ecor (time correction for entrant e) and Ccor (time correction for competition c).  This is different from what you had posted with Tund (an underlying time of entrant e), because by default the ANOVA model includes an overall mean (mu).  Make sure that both factors of interest (Ecor and Ccor) are treated as ""factors"" or ""categorical variables"" in whatever package you use.

Is my approach reasonable and how to adjust standard errors?,<standard-error><autocorrelation>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I want to run a simulation in which I want to find out whether there is a relation between the independent variable $x_t$ and the dependent variable $y_t$. I.e., in the following regression I want to find out if $\beta$ is signficantly different from zero:</p>

<p>$$ y_t = \beta x_t + \epsilon_t. $$</p>

<p>In empirical data, $y_t$ is stationary, but close to a random walk.I want to model it as an AR(1) process. Of course, I could just model $x_t$ as an AR(1) process and if $\beta$ is different from zero, $y_t$ would end up as such a process as well. However, I also want to consider the case in which $\beta=0$ and I don't want to confuse the reader with changing descriptions for different scenarios (i.e., ""if $\beta=1$ I simulate $y_t$ from the above equation, if $\beta=0$, I simulate $y_t$ as an AR(1) process."")</p>

<p>I came up with the following solution to this dilemma. Why not model both $y_t$ and $x_t$ as AR(1) processes with potentially correlated errors. That is:</p>

<p>$$ y_{t+1} =  \tau_y y_t  + u_{t+1}, \quad 0 &lt; \tau_y &lt; 1, \quad u_{t+1} \sim N(0, \sigma_u^2) $$ and
$$ x_{t+1} =  \tau_x x_t + v_{t+1} , \quad 0 &lt; \tau_x &lt; 1, \quad v_{t+1} \sim N(0, \sigma_{v}^2), $$</p>

<p>where </p>

<p>$$ cov\left(\begin{bmatrix} v_{t+1} \\ u_{t+1} \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} v_{t+1} &amp; u_{t+1} \end{bmatrix}\right) = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_v^2 &amp; \sigma_{v} \sigma_u \rho_{u,v} \\ 
\sigma_{v} \sigma_u \rho_{u,v} &amp; \sigma_u^2 \end{bmatrix} $$</p>

<p>Since $\beta = \frac{Cov(y, x)}{\sigma_x^2}$ and </p>

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
Cov(y, x) &amp;= E[y_{t+1}x_{t+1}] \\
&amp;= E[(\tau_y y_t + u_{t+1})(\tau_x x_t + v_{t+1})] \\
&amp;= \tau_y \tau_x E[y_t x_t] + E[u_{t+1} v_{t+1}] \\
&amp;= \tau_y \tau_x Cov(y, x)  + \sigma_{u} \sigma_{v} \rho_{v, u} \\
\end{aligned}
$$</p>

<p>we get by rearranging</p>

<p>$$ \beta = \frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_{v}}\rho_{v, u} \frac{1 - \tau_x^2}{1-\tau_x \tau_y}. $$</p>

<p>Fair enough, this is a little bit complicated, but it allows me to control $\beta$ without changing the structure of either $y_t$ or $x_t$ and both those processes are AR(1) in this setup. </p>

<p>I basically have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this a reasonable approach given the requirement that preferably both $x_t$ and $y_t$ should be AR(1) processes. The interpretation of the relation should really be just like in a simple OLS setup, i.e. has $x_t$ an impact on $y_t$ (I'm not concerned about causality here, just relation). Would you consider my setup still as a reasonable way of modelling it? (I just don't make a direct link, but use the error structure for that. I don't see a problem with this approach. If $x_t$ and $y_t$ are related via correlated shocks, so be it.)</li>
<li><p>I already simulated this and it works fine. However, I also want to obtain correct confidence intervals for each run. That is, I want to run the regression in the first equation, get $\widehat{\beta}$ and also standard errors that should be reasonable. Now I noticed that the errors are highly autocorrelated and this autocorrelation seems to be identical to $\tau_y$. However, I could not formalize it. So it would be great to know how I would have to adjust the standard errors. (It would be extra awesome if I could get a hint how to implement that in R.)</p>

<p>i.e. the variables are co-integrated. Then the relation</p>

<p>$$\Delta y_t = b \Delta x_t + \Delta \varepsilon_t$$<br>
also holds. Calculating the sample correlation of first-differences we will estimate the Covariance as</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}\operatorname{\hat Cov}(\Delta y_t,\Delta x_t)=&amp; \frac 1{T-1} \sum_{t=2}^{T}\left(b \Delta x_t + \Delta \varepsilon_t\right)\Delta x_t \\-&amp;\left(\frac 1{T-1} \sum_{t=2}^{T}\left(b \Delta x_t + \Delta \varepsilon_t\right)\right)\left(\frac 1{T-1} \sum_{t=2}^{T}\Delta x_t\right)\end{align} $$</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}=b\frac 1{T-1}&amp; \sum_{t=2}^{T}\left(\Delta x_t \right)^2 + \frac 1{T-1} \sum_{t=2}^{T}\left(\Delta x_t \Delta \varepsilon_t\right) \\ -&amp; b\left(\frac 1{T-1}\sum_{t=2}^{T} \Delta x_t\right)^2 -\left(\frac 1{T-1} \sum_{t=2}^{T}\Delta \varepsilon_t\right)\left(\frac 1{T-1} \sum_{t=2}^{T}\Delta x_t\right) \end{align}$$</p>

<p>To the degree that $x_t$ and $\varepsilon_t$ are independent, the terms involving the error will tend to vanish and so </p>

<p>$$ \operatorname{\hat Cov}(\Delta y_t,\Delta x_t)\rightarrow bs^2_{\Delta x_t} $$</p>

<p>where $s^2$ is the sample variance (irrespective of whether the variance of $x_t$, or $\Delta x_t$ is constant or not). </p>

<p>The sample variance of $\Delta y_t$ will be </p>

<p>$$s^2_{\Delta s_t} \approx b^2s^2_{\Delta x_t} + s^2_{\Delta \varepsilon_t}$$</p>

<p>again, irrespective of whether these sample moments estimate anything meaningfull.</p>

<p>So 
$$\operatorname {\hat Corr}(\Delta y_t,\Delta x_t)  \approx \frac {bs^2_{\Delta x_t}}{\sqrt {\left(b^2s^2_{\Delta x_t} + s^2_{\Delta \varepsilon_t}\right)}\sqrt {s^2_{\Delta x_t} }} = \frac {bs_{\Delta x_t}}{\sqrt {\left(b^2s^2_{\Delta x_t} + s^2_{\Delta \varepsilon_t}\right)}}$$</p>

<p>So the magnitude of the empirically estimated correlation of first differences, will depend on the magnitude of the variance of the error term (which moreover enters the expression <em>doubled</em> since we consider first differences). If this (constant) variance is large compared to the variance of $x_t$, then the estimated correlation of first-differences may be small to non-existent, even though the variables are co-integrated in levels.  </p>

The different faces make up a dataset stored in a matrix $X$ of size $K\times N$. You might be confused about the fact that you use the PCA to obtain a set of eigenvectors (eigenfaces) $I = \{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_D\}$ of the covariance matrix $X^TX$, where each $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$. You don't reduce the number of pixels used to represent a face, but rather you find a small number of eigenfaces that span a space which suitably represents your faces. The eigenfaces still live in the original space though (they have the same number of pixels as the original faces).</p>

<p>The idea is, that you use the obtained eigenfaces as a sort of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype"" rel=""nofollow"">archetypes</a> that can be used to perform face detection.</p>

<p>Also, purely in terms of storage costs, imagine you have to keep an album of $K$ faces, each composed of $N$ pixels. Instead of keeping all the $K$ faces, you just keep $D$ eigenfaces, where $D \ll K$, together with the component scores and you can recreate any face (with a certain loss in precision).</p>

<p>The question is vague because this is a data mining/data analysis question, and many methods will provide you with many (similar but different) results. There are no pros/cons here, since they all test for different things. For the methods you mentioned, here's a brief description:</p>

<ol>
<li>Chi-squared. This will tell you if there is a relation between your groups. I assume the test will be offspring versus all the vocalizations. You may find signficance but not be certain where it comes from. If you find a relation, you have to dig deeper to find the source. Avoid having groups with few observations otherwise this test will not be valid.</li>
<li>(Student) T-test, or a test of equivalence in means. You compare the mean value of two populations, versus the alternative hypothesis that they are not equal. You will need to test each vocalization individually.</li>
<li>ANOVA. You are testing if the variance is explained across different factors (offspring). This needs to be done for each different variable.  The idea is to look at the variance of the continuous variable within each class $s_i$ and compare it to the total variance st. The correlation coefficient for one class compared to the total is then $\nu_i=s_i/s_t$. This test also assumes normality.</li>
<li>MANOVA. This is testing if your qualitative factor (offspring) has an effect on ALL of the other variables. It is a generalization of ANOVA to multiple variables, which sounds appropriate for your study. We still have the normality assumption.</li>
<li>GLM. Modeling can show you the relationships in your data as well, but you need to have a predictor variable defined in advance. (Offspring?)</li>
</ol>

<p>Other ideas: If you are looking to see how your vocalizations are related only to offspring, then try perhaps a discriminant analysis (normality assumption again) or a logistic regression (no normality assumption).</p>

At this stage, if you can recommend a book, an idea, or a general sampling method that's all I'm asking for. I basically need a place to start.</p>

<p>For instance, I thought that maybe we could we divide the country into  three zones: low, medium, and high industrial zones (based on UN data). We could then create 100 equal-sized sectors within each zone, and randomly select 10 sectors from each of the three industrial zones. We would then survey these small sectors areas and find all toxic sites within those sectors. If we do this, could we estimate the total number of industrial sites along with a measure of uncertainty? Is there a name for this type of geographic sampling?</p>

The controls are sampled in a known proportion from the population of interest. Suppose further you are able to retrospectively ascertain all screening information in both groups and you interested in inferring the population level screening rates and the relative risk for disease adjusting for screening rates. Lastly, there are some subject level effects which you believe may mediate screening behavior and disease risk.</p>

<p>A probability model for the screening process is: </p>

<p>$$t_{i,j} \sim \mbox{exponential}(\lambda_s; t_{i,j-1})$$</p>

<p>where an $\mbox{exponential}(\lambda, t)$ random variable is a location shifted exponential distribution with location parameter $t$. So the number of screens that a person utilizes in a fixed time period has a Poisson distribution.</p>

<p>Disease develops according to another approximately exponential process </p>

<p>$$D_i \sim \mbox{exponential} (\lambda_c)$$</p>

<p>and is clinically detectable with screening for a short interval, $\theta_{d}$. </p>

<p>$\lambda_s \gg \lambda_c$ obviously. Disease prevalence is very rare in the population.</p>

<p>Disease status $D_i(t)$ is 1 if the subject has either screen detected or symptomatic disease at time $t$, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>The time varying subject level effects (age) we denote with $X_{i,t}$, so all $\lambda_c$, $\lambda_s$, and $\theta_d$ are conditionally dependent on $X_{i,t}$.</p>

<p>This is a type of analysis whose name is not familiar to me. I'm inclined to call it ""cluster case control"" since the individual observation is a single screening period. However, we did not sample screens based on case/control status, but individuals. Because of the variability in lead time and individual screening rates, cases screen above the population rate and controls screen below it. Thus it's tempting to use some kind of sampling weight to account for this and obtain an unbiased estimate of the population level screening rate. However, the subject frequency:</p>

<p>$$w_i = \left\{\begin{array}{ccc} 
1 &amp; \mbox{if} &amp; D_{i}(T) = 1 \\
1/p &amp; \mbox{if} &amp; D_{i}(T) = 0 \\
\end{array} \right.$$</p>

<p>does not produce valid weights because of the lead time bias and differential screening (controls are followed for a longer period of time and so accrue more screening instances <em>and</em> person years, while cases are followed for shorter times and still accrue more screening intervals than cases in shorter time periods, yet still not more overall).</p>

<p>Leaving aside considerations of biased tests (which are not uncommon in goodness of fit, so it's worth a mention), there are three situations relating to rejection rate one might want to consider:</p>

<p>1) the rejection rate when simulating from the null (as you seem to be doing in your question)</p>

<p>Here, the rejection rate should be at or near the significance level, so, no, if you hold the significance level constant, the rejection rate doesn't decrease as <em>n</em> increases, but stays at/near $\alpha$.</p>

<p>2) the rejection rate when simulating from some alternative</p>

<p>Here the rejection rate should increase as <em>n</em> increases.</p>

<p>3) the rejection rate for some collection of real data</p>

<p>Practically, the null is never actually true, and real data will have some mixture of amounts of non-normality (as measured by the test statistic). If the degree of non-normality is not related to sample size, the rejection rate should increase as <em>n</em> increases.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gPnim.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>For example in the graph above, lets think that we are only given X and no other variable has been observed. Then according to the rules of d-separation, the information flow from X to D:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>X influences A, which is $P(A)\neq P(A|X)$. This is OK, since A causes X and if we know about the effect X, this affects our belief about the cause A. Information flows.</p></li>
<li><p>X influences B,which is $P(B)\neq P(B|X)$. This is OK, since A has been changed by our knowledge about X, the change at A can influence our beliefs about its cause, B, as well.</p></li>
<li><p>X influences C,which is $P(C)\neq P(C|X)$. This is OK because we know that B is biased by our knowledge about its indirect effect, X, and since B is biased by X, this will influence B's all direct and indirect effects. C is a direct effect of B and it is influenced by our knowledge about X.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Well, up to this point, everything is OK for me since the flow of the information occurs according to intuitive cause-effect relationships. But I don't get the special behavior of so called ""V-structures"" or ""Colliders"" in this scheme. According to the d-Separation theory, B and D are the common causes of C in the graph above and it says that if we did not observe C or any of its descendants, the flow information from X is blocked at C. Well, OK, but my question is <strong><em>why?</em></strong></p>

<p>From the three steps above, started from X, we saw that C is influenced by our knowledge about X and the information flow occurred according to the cause-effect relationship. The d-Separation theory says that we cannot go from C to D since C is not observed. But I think that since we know that C is biased and D is a cause of C, D should be affected as well while the theory says the opposite. I am clearly missing something in my thinking pattern but can't see what it is.</p>

<p>So I need an explanation of why the flow of information blocked at C, if C is not observed.</p>

58470,5821.0,2,,58467.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think you're talking about point estimation as in parametric inference, so that we can assume a parametric probability model for a data generating mechanism but the actual value of the parameter is unknown.</p>

<p>Maximum likelihood estimation refers to using a probability model for data and optimizing the joint likelihood function of the observed data over one or more parameters. It's therefore seen that the estimated parameters are most consistent with the observed data relative to any other parameter in the parameter space. Note such likelihood functions aren't necessarily viewed as being ""conditional"" upon the parameters since the parameters aren't random variables, hence it's somewhat more sophisticated to conceive of the likelihood of various outcomes comparing two different parameterizations. It turns out this is a philosophically sound approach.</p>

<p>Bayesian estimation is a bit more general because we're not necessarily maximizing the Bayesian analogue of the likelihood (the posterior density). However, the analogous type of estimation (or posterior mode estimation) is seen as maximizing the probability of the posterior parameter conditional upon the data. Usually, Bayes' estimates obtained in such a manner behave nearly exactly like those of ML. The key difference is that Bayes inference allows for an explicit method to incorporate prior information.</p>

The actual data is as follows:</p>

<p>$$X_1(60, 3.0)$$
$$X_2(61, 1.0)$$
$$X_3(58, 2.3)$$
$$X_4(63, 2.4)$$
$$X_5(61, 1.7)$$
So swimmer 1 ($X_1$) has a mean finishing time of 60 seconds with a standard deviation of 3.0 seconds.</p>

<p>Question 1: What is the probability of an event where $X_i$ finishes first. e.g.</p>

<p>$$P(X_1 \lt X_i, i=2,\ldots,n)$$</p>

<p>Question 2: If I calculate this for all swimmers, can I simply order the results to determine the most probable finishing order?</p>

<p>This is not homework.</p>

<p>Based on the answers to this <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/44139/what-is-px-1x-2-x-1x-3-x-1x-n"">Cross Validated question</a>, I have tried to solve this problem <em>based on</em> the first answer. i.e.</p>

<p>$$\Pr(X_1 \le X_i, i=2,\ldots,n) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi_1(t) [1 - \Phi_2(t)]\cdots[1 - \Phi_n(t)]dt$$</p>

<p>Where  $\phi_i$ is the PDF of $X_i$ and $\Phi_i$ is its CDF.</p>

<p>Based on this formula, the results I obtained were:</p>

<p>$$\Pr(X_1 \le X_i, i=2\ldots5) = 0.259653$$
$$\Pr(X_2 \le X_i, i=1,3\ldots5) = 0.214375$$
$$\Pr(X_3 \le X_i, i=1\ldots2, 4\ldots5) = 0.611999$$
$$\Pr(X_4 \le X_i, i=1\ldots3, 5) = 0.0263479$$
$$\Pr(X_5 \le X_i, i=1\ldots4) = 0.0697597$$
However, the probabilities add to 1.182135 when they should add to 1.0. I’m not sure if the formula is incorrect or my implementation of the integral (I used Excel and the trapezoidal method).</p>

<p>I also attempted to solve the problem using Dillip’s method (from the above mentioned question) as follows:</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
P(X_1 &lt; \max X_i) &amp;=  P\{(X_1 &lt; X_2) \cup \cdots \cup (X_1 &lt; X_n)\\
&amp;\leq \sum_{i=2}^n P(X_1 &lt; X_i)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=2}^n Q\left(\frac{\mu_1 - \mu_i}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_i^2}}\right)
\end{align*}</p>

<p>However, the probability results were much greater than 1 in most cases so abandoned this approach. By the way, what exactly does $\max X_i$ mean?</p>

<p>Of course if you need something to more directly replicate the signed rank test, various things can be constructed that do that, which could even include the interval for the pseudo-median (i.e. the one-sample Hodges-Lehmann location estimate, the median of pairwise averages). </p>

58488,20470.0,2,,58467.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>It is a very broad question and my answer here only begins to scratch the surface a bit. I will use the Bayes's rule to explain the concepts. </p>

<p>Let’s assume that a set of probability distribution parameters,  $\theta$, best explains the dataset $D$. We may wish to estimate the parameters $\theta$ with the help of the Bayes’ Rule:</p>

<p>$$p(\theta|D)=\frac{p(D|\theta) * p(\theta)}{p(D)}$$</p>

<p>$$posterior = \frac{likelihood * prior}{evidence}$$</p>

<p>The explanations follow:</p>

<p><strong>Maximum Likelihood Estimate</strong></p>

<p>With MLE,we seek a point value for $\theta$ which maximizes the likelihood, $p(D|\theta)$, shown in the equation(s) above. We can denote this value as $\hat{\theta}$. In MLE, $\hat{\theta}$ is a point estimate, not a random variable.</p>

<p>In other words, in the equation above, MLE treats the term $\frac{p(\theta)}{p(D)}$ as a constant and does NOT allow us to inject our prior beliefs, $p(\theta)$, about the likely values for $\theta$ in the estimation calculations.</p>

<p><strong>Bayesian Estimate</strong></p>

<p>Bayesian estimation, by contrast, fully calculates (or at times approximates) the posterior distribution $p(\theta|D)$. Bayesian inference treats $\theta$ as a random variable. In Bayesian estimation, we put in probability density functions and get out probability density functions, rather than a single point as in MLE. </p>

<p>Of all the $\theta$ values made possible by the output distribution $p(\theta|D)$, it is our job to select a value that we consider best in some sense. For example, we may choose the expected value of $\theta$ assuming its variance is small enough. The variance that we can calculate for the parameter $\theta$ from its posterior distribution allows us to express our confidence in any specific value we may use as an estimate. If the variance is too large, we may declare that there does not exist a good estimate for $\theta$.</p>

<p>As a trade-off, Bayesian estimation is made complex by the fact that we now have to deal with the denominator in the Bayes' rule, i.e. $evidence$. Here evidence -or probability of evidence- is represented by:</p>

<p>$$p(D) = \int_{\theta} p(D|\theta) * p(\theta) d\theta$$</p>

<p>This leads to the concept of 'conjugate priors' in Bayesian estimation. For a given likelihood function, if we have a choice regarding how we express our prior beliefs, we must use that form which allows us to carry out the integration shown above. The idea of conjugate priors and how they are practically implemented are explained quite well in <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/58564/help-me-understand-bayesian-prior-and-posterior-distributions/58792#58792"">this post</a> by COOlSerdash.</p>

<p>It is arguable that boxplots, now very popular, are massively overused for one-sample and two-sample exploration. (Their real value, in my view, is when you are comparing many sets of values, with number of samples or groups or variables more like 10, 30 or 100, and there is a major need to see overall patterns amid a mass of possible detail.) </p>

<p>The key point is that with just one or two samples (groups, variables), you have space on a plot to show much more detail, detail that could be interesting or important for comparison. With a good design, such detail need not be distracting in visual comparison. </p>

<p>Evidently, in most usual versions the box plot suppresses all detail in its box, showing the middle half of the data, except in so far as the position of the median inside the box conveys some information. Depending on the exact rules used, such as the 1.5 IQR convention of showing data points individually if and only if they are 1.5 IQR or more from the nearer quartile, it is even possible that the box plot suppresses most of the detail about the other half of the data. Often, and perhaps even usually, such detail may be irrelevant to something like a Wilcoxon test, but being prepared to see something illuminating in the data display is always a good idea. </p>

<p>A display that remains drastically underused in many fields is the quantile plot, a display of the ordered values against an associated cumulative probability. (For other slightly technical reasons, this cumulative probability is typically not $1/n, \cdots, n/n$ for sample size $n$ but something like $(i - 0.5)/n$ for rank $i$, 1 being the rank of the smallest value.)  </p>

<p>Here are your example data with a reference line added for 1.1. </p>

<p>In other examples, key points include </p>

<ul>
<li><p>For two-sample comparisons, there are easy choices between superimposing traces, juxtaposing traces, or using related plots such as quantile-quantile plots. </p></li>
<li><p>The plot performs well over a range of sample sizes. </p></li>
<li><p>Outliers, granularity (lots of ties), gaps, bi- or multimodality will all be shown as or much more clearly than in box plots. </p></li>
<li><p>Quantile plots mesh well with monotonic transformations, which is not so true for box plots. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some will want to point out that cumulative distribution plots or survival function plots show the same information, and that's fine by me.  </p>

<p>See W.S. Cleveland's books (details at <a href=""http://store.hobart.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://store.hobart.com/</a>) for restrained but effective advocacy of quantile plots. </p>

<p>R details I leave for others. I am focusing here on the more general statistical graphics question, which clearly cuts across statistical science and all software possibilities. </p>

58506,23057.0,2,,57403.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Mantel test and Moran's I refer to two very different concepts.  </p>

<p>The reason for using Moran's I is the question of spatial autocorrelation: correlation of a variable with itself through space. One uses Moran's I when wants to know to which extent the occurrence of an event in an areal unit makes more likely or unlikely the occurrence of an event in a neighboring areal unit. In other words (using your example): if there is a noisy crow on a tree, how likely or unlikely are there other noisy crows in the neighborhood? The null hypothesis for Moran's I is no spatial autocorrelation in the variable of interest.  </p>

<p>The reason for using the Mantel test is the question of similarities or dissimilarities between variables. One uses the Mantel test when wants to know whether samples that are similar in terms of the predictor (space) variables also tend to be similar in terms of the dependent (species) variable. To put it simply: Are samples that are close together also compositionally similar and are samples that are spatially distant from each other also compositionally dissimilar? Using your example: it tests whether quiet crows are located near other quiet crows, while noisy crows have noisy neighbors. The null hypothesis is no relationship between spatial location and the DV.<br>
Besides this, the partial Mantel test allows comparing two variables while controlling for a third one.<br>
For example, one needs the Mantel test when compares </p>

<ul>
<li>Two groups of organisms, which form the same set of sample units;</li>
<li>Community structure before and after disturbance;</li>
<li>Genetic/ecological distance and geographic distance.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/1400528"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here</a> is a good discussion on the Mantel test and its application.</p>

<p>(Edited in response to Ladislav Nado's new examples)</p>

<p>If I may guess, the reason for your confusion is that you keep thinking of space and noise in your examples either as of two continuous variables, or as of one distance matrix (position in space) and one continuous variable (noise). In fact, to analyze similarities between two such variables, one should think of <em>both</em> of them as <em>distance matrices</em>. That is: </p>

<ul>
<li>one matrix (for example, for space) describes the differences for each pair of geographic coordinates. Value for 2 crows sitting next to each other is lower than the value for crows sitting far apart;</li>
<li>another matrix (for environmental, genetic, or any other structure) describes the differences between measured outcomes at given points. The value for 2 crows with a similar level of noise (it doesn't matter if they are quiet or noisy--it's just a measure of similarity!) is lower than the value for a pair of crows with dissimilar levels of noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the Mantel test computes the cross-product of the corresponding values in these two matrices. Let me underline again that <em>the Mantel statistic is the correlation between two distance matrices and is not equivalent to the correlation between the variables</em>, used to form those matrices. </p>

<p>Now let's take two structures you showed in pictures A and B.<br>
In picture A, the distance in each pair of crows corresponds to similarities in their level of noise. Crows with small differences in their level of noise (each quiet crow vs. another quiet crow, each noisy crow vs. another noisy crow) stay close, while each and every pair of crows with big difference in their level of noise (a quiet crow vs. a noisy crow) stay away from each other. The Mantel test correctly shows that there is a spatial correlation between the two matrices.<br>
In picture B, however, the distance between crows does <em>not</em> correspond to the similarities in their level of noise. While all noisy crows stay together, quiet crows may or may not stay close. In fact, the distance in some pairs of dissimilar crows (one quiet+one noisy) is smaller than the distance for some pairs of similar crows (when both are quiet).<br>
There is no evidence in picture B that if a researcher picks up two similar crows at random, they would be neighbors. There is no evidence that if a researcher picks up two neighboring (or not so distant) crows at random, they would be similar. Hence, the initial claim that <code>On both plots the hypothesis valid</code> is incorrect. The structure as in picture B shows no spatial correlation between the two matrices and accordingly fails the Mantel test.</p>

<p>Of course, different types of structures (with one or more clusters of similar objects or without clear cluster borders at all) exist in reality. And the Mantel test is perfectly applicable and very useful for testing what it tests. If I may recommend another good reading, <a href=""http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_6/b_fdi_47-48/010010612.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> uses real data and discusses Moran's I, Geary's c, and the Mantel test in quite simple and understandable terms.</p>

<p>Hope everything is slightly more clear now; though, I can expand this explanation if you feel like there is still something missing.</p>

A narrow view of this question (since the other answers and comments I believe have covered adequately various general approaches) is ""Assume two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are dependent. Does the variance of $X$ conditional on $Y$ is a function of the variance of $Y$?</p>

<p>To take refuge in the normal distribution, if both $X$ and $Y$ are normal and dependent, denote $\sigma^2_x$, $\sigma^2_y$, $\sigma_{xy}$ their unconditional variances and their covariance respectively. Then </p>

<p>$$\operatorname {Var}(X\mid Y) = \sigma^2_x-\frac {\sigma_{xy}^2}{\sigma^2_y} $$</p>

<p>which is increasing in $\sigma^2_y$. Note that the direction of their covariance (positive/negative) doesn't matter.</p>

<p>But also, note that the conditional variance is <em>lower</em> than the unconditional variance...</p>

<p><strong>NARROW VIEW 2</strong><br>
A 2nd narrow view of the matter is: consider pairs of random variables $(X_i,Y_i),\; i=1,...,n$, and $\sigma^2_x(i)$ and $\sigma^2_y(i)$ their unconditional variances. Assume that for some indices $k,j \in [1,...,n]$, we have $\sigma^2_y(k) &gt; \sigma^2_y(j), \forall j\neq k$.<br>
Should we ""expect"" that $\sigma^2_x(k) &gt; \sigma^2_x(j), \forall j\neq k$ also?<br>
This formalization of the OP's question requires from us to consider directly the dependence of each $(X_i,Y_i)$ on a common source, say a vector of random variables $\mathbf Z_i$,  So we have</p>

<p>$$X_i = h_i(\mathbf Z_i),\;\; Y_i = g_i(\mathbf Z_i)$$</p>

<p>Then we ask ""does (or when)
$$ \operatorname {Var}[g_k(\mathbf Z_k)]&gt;\operatorname {Var}[g_j(\mathbf Z_j)] \Rightarrow ? \operatorname {Var}[h_k(\mathbf Z_k)]&gt;\operatorname {Var}[h_j(\mathbf Z_j)],\; \forall j\neq k$$</p>

<p>To be able to tell something about such an inequality, it must be the case that at least some of the variables that appear in $Z_j$, must also appear in the other $Z_i$'s: then as a necessary condition, we do not only require that the elements of each pair of $(X_i,Y_i)$ rv's are dependent -we require also that the pairs are dependent between them: good-bye i.i.d samples...</p>

58498,21638.0,2,,58475.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I always find it best in these situations to run a Monte Carlo simulation to check (roughly) what the correct answer should be. Here is some <code>R</code> code for doing that:</p>

<pre><code>doRace &lt;- function()
{
  times &lt;- rnorm(mean=c(60,61,58,63,61),sd=c(3,1,2.3,2.4,1.7),n=5)
  winner &lt;- which.min(times)
  winner
}

winners &lt;- replicate(n=10000,expr=doRace())
table(winners) / length(winners)
</code></pre>

<p>Which gives the following output for me (of course you will get slightly different answers depending on the state of your random number generator):</p>

<pre><code>winners
 1      2      3      4      5 
0.2573 0.0317 0.6108 0.0282 0.0720
</code></pre>

<p>This indicates that the issue is with swimmer 2, as these results otherwise agree well with yours. I suspect you just have an incorrect cell reference somewhere. <strong>Note that a reasonable resolution to the problem is to use the Monte Carlo simulation not just as a verification method but as the final implementation for calculating the probabilities. After all, numerical integration is itself an approximate and computationally expensive procedure.</strong></p>

<p>In order to be absolutely sure, we can use the <code>integrate()</code> function in <code>R</code>. First define the integral:</p>

<pre><code>integral&lt;- function(x,whichSwimmer)
{
  means &lt;- c(60,61,58,63,61)
  sds &lt;- c(3,1,2.3,2.4,1.7)

  dnorm(x,mean=means[whichSwimmer],sd=sds[whichSwimmer]) *
    (1 - pnorm(x,mean=means[-whichSwimmer][1],sd=sds[-whichSwimmer][1])) *
    (1 - pnorm(x,mean=means[-whichSwimmer][2],sd=sds[-whichSwimmer][2])) *
    (1 - pnorm(x,mean=means[-whichSwimmer][3],sd=sds[-whichSwimmer][3])) *
    (1 - pnorm(x,mean=means[-whichSwimmer][4],sd=sds[-whichSwimmer][4]))
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can calculate the probability for each swimmer in turn:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;integrate(integral,whichSwimmer=1,lower=0,upper=100)
0.2596532 with absolute error &lt; 2.5e-05

&gt;integrate(integral,whichSwimmer=2,lower=0,upper=100)
0.03223977 with absolute error &lt; 6.4e-06

&gt;integrate(integral,whichSwimmer=3,lower=0,upper=100)
0.6119995 with absolute error &lt; 1.5e-06

&gt;integrate(integral,whichSwimmer=4,lower=0,upper=100)
0.02634785 with absolute error &lt; 1.4e-06

&gt;integrate(integral,whichSwimmer=5,lower=0,upper=100)
0.06975967 with absolute error &lt; 8.1e-05
</code></pre>

<p>Which gives very good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation.</p>

<p>Note that although you can technically give <code>lower</code> and <code>upper</code> bounds of negative/positive infinity to <code>integrate()</code> I found that this caused the procedure to break down, giving clearly incorrect results.</p>

<p>EDIT: I've just noticed you had a second question regarding the most likely ordering of swimmers. Again, we can easily check whether the intuition about just ordering the probability of each swimmer winning is correct by running a Monte Carlo simulation. We just need to adapt the sampling function to return the order of the swimmers rather than only the winner:</p>

<pre><code>doRace &lt;- function()
{
  times &lt;- rnorm(mean=c(60,61,58,63,61),sd=c(3,1,2.3,2.4,1.7),n=5)
  finishOrder &lt;- order(times)

  paste(finishOrder,collapse="""")
}

finishOrders &lt;- replicate(n=1e6,expr=doRace())
which.max(table(finishOrders) / length(finishOrders))
</code></pre>

<p>I get the ouput:</p>

<pre><code>31254 
   50
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, the most likely order is $3,1,2,5,4$ which is not the same as ordering the swimmers by their probability of winning!</p>

<p>For me, this is another reason to prefer the Monte Carlo approach as the final implementation as you can easily answer this and other questions - e.g. what is each swimmer's probability of finishing <em>second</em> or, given that swimmer $1$ finishes first, what is the most likely ordering of the remaining swimmers?</p>

<p>EDIT 2: To be able to answer these other questions, we need to change the sampling function again, this time to return the complete order in which the swimmers finish:</p>

<pre><code>doRace &lt;- function()
{
  times &lt;- rnorm(mean=c(60,61,58,63,61),sd=c(3,1,2.3,2.4,1.7),n=5)
  finishOrder &lt;- order(times)

  finishOrder
}

finishOrders &lt;- replicate(n=1e6,expr=doRace())
</code></pre>

<p><code>finishOrders</code> is a matrix where each column corresponds to a single simulated race, the first row gives the winner of each race, the second row the second placed swimmer of each race and so on. So, to get the probability that each swimmer finishes second we do:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; table(finishOrders[2,]) / ncol(finishOrders)

       1        2        3        4        5 
0.271749 0.198205 0.235460 0.075165 0.219421
</code></pre>

<p>To find the most likely order given that swimmer $1$ wins the race is a little more fiddly. First, extract all races where the first row is equal to $1$:</p>

<pre><code>finishOrdersWhen1WinsRace &lt;- finishOrders[,finishOrders[1,]==1]
</code></pre>

<p>Then turn the finish order of each race from a vector of numbers into a character string so we can use the <code>table</code> function to find the most frequent one:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; which.max(table(apply(finishOrdersWhen1WinsRace,2,paste,collapse="""")))
13254 
    8
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, given that swimmer $1$ wins the race, the most likely order of the remaining swimmers is $3,2,5,4$, which occurs:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; max(table(apply(finishOrdersWhen1WinsRace,2,paste,collapse="""")) / ncol(finishOrdersWhen1WinsRace))
[1] 0.2341227
</code></pre>

<p>$23.4\%$ of the time.</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether a Monte Carlo approach is the only way to answer these questions but it seems likely that even if you can obtain closed-form expressions for the probabilities you'll need to rely on numerical integration like you did to find the winning probabilities.</p>

<p>Using an example from Pearl's book on causality, let C be the observation that the lawn is wet, D the event that it rained, and B the event that the sprinkler was on.

58512,668.0,2,,58446.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p><strong>Understanding power analysis of statistical hypothesis tests can be enhanced by carrying some out and looking closely at the results.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>By design, a test of size <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span> is <em>intended</em> to reject the null hypothesis with a chance of at least <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span> when the null is true (its expected <em>false positive rate</em>).</strong>  When we have the ability (or luxury) of choosing among alternative procedures with this property we would prefer those that (a) actually come close to the nominal false positive rate and (b) have relatively higher chances of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is not true.</p>

<p>The second criterion requires us to stipulate <em>in what way(s)</em> and <em>by how much</em> the null fails to be true.  In textbook cases this is easy, because the alternatives are limited in scope and clearly specified.  With distribution tests like the Shapiro-Wilk, the alternative are much more vague: they are ""non-normal.""  When choosing among distribution tests, then, the analyst is likely to have to conduct their own one-off power study to assess how well the tests work against more specific alternative hypotheses that are of concern in the problem at hand.</p>

<p><strong>An example</strong> motivated by Michael Mayer's answer posits that the alternative distribution may have qualities similar to those of the family of Student t distributions.  This family, parameterized by a number <span class=""math-container"">$\nu\ge 1$</span> (as well as by location and scale) includes in the limit of large <span class=""math-container"">$\nu$</span> the Normal distributions.</p>

<p>In either situation--whether evaluating the actual test size or its power--<strong>we must generate independent samples from a specified distribution, run the test on each sample, and find the rate at which it rejects the null hypothesis.</strong>  However, there is more information available in any test result: its P-value.  By retaining the set of P-values produced during such a simulation, we can later assess the rate at which the test would reject the null for <em>any</em> value of <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span> we might care about.  The heart of the power analysis, then, is a subroutine that generates this P-value distribution (either by simulation, as just described, or--occasionally--with a theoretical formula).  Here is an example coded in <code>R</code>.  Its arguments include</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>rdist</code>, the name of a function to produce a random sample from some distribution</p></li>
<li><p><code>n</code>, the size of samples to request of <code>rdist</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>n.iter</code>, the number of such samples to obtain</p></li>
<li><p><code>...</code>, any optional parameters to be passed on to <code>rdist</code> (such as the degrees of freedom <span class=""math-container"">$\nu$</span>).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The remaining parameters control the display of the results; they are included mainly as a convenience for generating the figures in this answer.</p>

<pre><code>sim &lt;- function(rdist, n, n.iter, prefix="""",
                breaks=seq(0, 1, length.out=20), alpha=0.05,
                plot=TRUE, ...) {

  # The simulated P-values.
  # NB: The optional arguments ""..."" are passed to `rdist` to specify
  #     its parameters (if any).
  x &lt;- apply(matrix(rdist(n*n.iter, ...), ncol=n.iter), 2, 
             function(y) shapiro.test(y)$p.value)

  # The histogram of P-values, if requested.
  if (plot) {
    power &lt;- mean(x &lt;= alpha)
    round.n &lt;- 1+ceiling(log(1 + n.iter * power * (1-power), base=10) / 2)
    hist(x[x &lt;= max(breaks)], xlab=paste(""P value (n="", n, "")"", sep=""""), 
         breaks=breaks, 
         main=paste(prefix, ""(power="", format(power, digits=round.n), "")"", sep=""""))
    # Specially color the ""significant"" part of the histogram
    hist(x[x &lt;= alpha], breaks=breaks, col=""#e0404080"", add=TRUE)
  }

  # Return the array of P-values for any further processing.
  return(x)
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see the computation actually takes just one line; the rest of the code plots the histogram.  To illustrate, let's use it to compute the expected false positive rates.  ""Rates"" is in the plural because the properties of a test usually vary with the sample size.  Since it is well-known that distributional tests have high power against qualitatively small alternatives when sample sizes are large, this study focuses on a range of small sample sizes where such tests of often applied in practice: typically about <span class=""math-container"">$5$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$100.$</span>  To save computation time, I report only on values of <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> from <span class=""math-container"">$5$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$20.$</span></p>

<pre><code>n.iter &lt;- 10^5                 # Number of samples to generate
n.spec &lt;- c(5, 10, 20)         # Sample sizes to study

system.time(
  invisible(sapply(n.spec, function(n) sim(rnorm, n, n.iter, prefix=""DF = Inf "")))
)
</code></pre>

<p>After specifying the parameters, this code also is just one line.  It yields the following output:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LrE8p.png"" alt=""Histograms for the null""></p>

<p><strong>This is the expected appearance:</strong> the histograms show nearly uniform distributions of P-values across the full range from <span class=""math-container"">$0$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$1$</span>.  With the nominal size set at <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha=0.05,$</span> the simulations report between <span class=""math-container"">$.0481$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$0.0499$</span> of the P-values were actually less than that threshold: these are the results highlighted in red.  The closeness of these frequencies to the nominal value attests that the Shapiro-Wilk test does perform as advertised.</p>

<p>(There does seem to be a tendency towards an unusually high frequency of P-values near <span class=""math-container"">$1$</span>.  This is of little concern, because in almost all applications the only P-values one looks at are <span class=""math-container"">$0.2$</span> or less.)</p>

<p><strong>Let's turn now to assessing the power.</strong>  The full range of values of <span class=""math-container"">$\nu$</span> for the Student t distribution can adequately be studied by assessing a few instances from around <span class=""math-container"">$\nu=100$</span> down to <span class=""math-container"">$\nu=1$</span>.  How do I know that?  I performed some preliminary runs using very small numbers of iterations (from <span class=""math-container"">$100$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$1000$</span>), which takes no time at all.  The code now requires a double loop (and in more complex situations we often need triple or quadruple loops to accommodate all the aspects we need to vary): one to study how the power varies with the sample size and another to study how it varies with the degrees of freedom.  Once again, though, everything is done in just one line of code (the third and final):</p>

<pre><code>df.spec &lt;- c(64, 16, 4, 2, 1)
par(mfrow=c(length(n.spec), length(df.spec)))
for (n in n.spec) 
  for (df in df.spec)
    tmp &lt;- sim(rt, n, n.iter, prefix=paste(""DF ="", df, """"), df=df)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fql7v.png"" alt=""Histograms for the alternatives""></p>

<p><strong>A little study of this tableau provides good intuition about power.</strong>  I would like to draw attention to its most salient and useful aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As the degrees of freedom reduce from <span class=""math-container"">$\nu=64$</span> on the left to <span class=""math-container"">$\nu=1$</span> on the right, more and more of the P-values are small, showing that the power to discriminate these distributions from a Normal distribution increases.  (The power is quantified in each plot title: it equals the proportion of the histogram's area that is red.)</p></li>
<li><p>As the sample size increase from <span class=""math-container"">$n=5$</span> on the top row to <span class=""math-container"">$n=20$</span> on the bottom, the power also increases.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice how as the alternative distribution differs more from the null distribution and the sample size increases, the P-values start collecting to the left, but there is still a ""tail"" of them stretching all the way to <span class=""math-container"">$1$</span>.  This is characteristic of power studies.  It shows that <strong>testing is a gamble</strong>: even when the null hypothesis is flagrantly violated and even when our sample size is reasonably large, our formal test may fail to produce a significant result.</p></li>
<li><p>Even in the extreme case at the bottom right, where a sample of <span class=""math-container"">$20$</span> is drawn from a Student t distribution with <span class=""math-container"">$1$</span> degree of freedom (a Cauchy distribution), the power is not <span class=""math-container"">$1$</span>: there is a <span class=""math-container"">$100 - 86.57 = 13\%$</span> chance that a sample of <span class=""math-container"">$20$</span> iid Cauchy variates will not be considered significantly different from Normal at a level of <span class=""math-container"">$5\%$</span> (that is, with <span class=""math-container"">$95\%$</span> confidence).</p></li>
<li><p>We could assess the power at any value of <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span> we choose by coloring more or fewer of the bars on these histograms.  For instance, to evaluate the power at <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha=0.10$</span>, color in the left two bars on each histogram and estimate its area as a fraction of the total.</p>

<p>(This won't work too well for values of <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span> smaller than <span class=""math-container"">$0.05$</span> with this figure.  In practice, one would limit the histograms to P-values only in the range that would be used, perhaps from <span class=""math-container"">$0$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$20\%$</span>, and show them in enough detail to enable visual assessment of power down to <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha=0.01$</span> or even <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha=0.005$</span>.  (That is what the <code>breaks</code> option to <code>sim</code> is for.)  Post-processing of the simulation results can provide even more detail.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is amusing that so much can be gleaned from what, in effect, amounts to three lines of code: one to simulate i.i.d. samples from a specified distribution, one to apply that to an array of null distributions, and the third to apply it to an array of alternative distributions.  These are the three steps that go into any power analysis: the rest is just summarizing and interpreting the results.</p>

What I don't quite understand is how to select the ""best"" model when eliminating insignificant variables.
The original model contained four independant variables of which three turned out to be insignificant (p-value > 0.05). So I removed, say X1, which had the largest p-value (small t-stat). The new model containing three variables clearly appeared to be better, as Adjusted R2 rose (I understand Adjusted R Square is suitable for comparing models with different number of parameters). The F-tests also seemed to confirm that removing X1 was the right thing to do due to its insignificance.
However, in the three variable model there was still one insignificant variable, X3. So I removed it as well. Now, in the two variable model, both variables were reliable (small p-values), but Adjusted R Square was actually somewhat lower than that of the previous model. F-tests seemed to indicate that X3 had a small enough impact on the model to be eliminated.
Which is actually the better model statistically and economically? The three variable model with the highest Adjusted R Square or the two variable model with no insignificant variables but lower Adjusted R2? I couldn't quite figure out the logic behind this.</p>

  <p>Question 2: If I calculate this for all swimmers, can I simply order the results to determine the most probable finishing order? </p>

<p>Not quite - if you have two swimmers with the same mean time in the middle of the group then the chance of one beating the other is $\frac12$, but the one with the higher standard deviation is more likely to be the overall winner: in your particular example, the chance of $X_2$ beating $X_5$ is $0.5$ but $X_5$ is more likely than $X_2$ to be the overall winner, so $X_5$ is less likely than $X_2$ to be third because of its higher standard deviation.</p>

<p>Using simulation, the most likely finishing order is $X_3,X_1,X_2,X_5,X_4$ (with a probability about 9.0%) above $X_3,X_1,X_5,X_2,X_4$ (about 8.0%), $X_1,X_3,X_2,X_5,X_4$ (about 6.1%), $X_3,X_2,X_5,X_1,X_4$ (about 5.8%), $X_1,X_3,X_5,X_2,X_4$ (also about 5.8%), $X_3,X_5,X_1,X_2,X_4$ (about 4.5%) and other less likely outcomes.

In any case, caution should be used when confronting collinearity in logistic regression.  Parameter estimates are often difficult to obtain and unreliable.

<p>If your variables have a high correlation coefficient, but are not truly collinear, then it still isn't incredibly surprising to get the opposite sign behavior you observe (I say this without knowing more details of your problem), depending on what other variables are in your model.

They may be correlated with each other, but have opposite effects in predicting an outcome, especially if grouped with other variables.</p>

<p>I don't have a book to recommend you, but you could model your uncertainty using the Poisson distribution, with the $\lambda =$ No. of Toxic Waste Sites per Square Kilometer.
You could carry out your sampling program as you described and then find the maximum likelihood estimator for $\lambda_{Ai}$ where A is the area of a sampling sector in zone $i$. In particular, you would maximize the following formula wrt $\lambda_{Ai}$ where $N_i$= number of sectors sampled from zone $i$:</p>

<p>$\max\limits_{\lambda_{Ai}} \prod\limits_{j=1}^{N_i} \frac{e^{-\lambda_{Ai}}\lambda_{Ai}^{n_{ij}}}{n_{ij}!}$ where $n_{ij}$ is the number of toxic sites in sector $j$ of zone $i$. The value of $\lambda_{Ai}$ that maximizes the product is $\lambda_{Ai}^* = \frac{1}{N_i}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N_i}{n_{ij}}$</p>

<p>You will get one estimate per zone, $\lambda_{Ai}^*$, which you can interpret as the frequency of toxic waste sites within a region of area $A_i$. Your uncertainty for the total number of sites in Zone $i$ with total area $A_{Ti}$can be modeled using your estimated $\lambda_{Ai}^*$ in the Poisson distribution: $Poisson(\lambda_{Ai}^*\frac{A_{Ti}}{A_i})$.</p>

<p>To get a country-wide estiamte, you would need to combine the $\lambda_{Ai}^*$ into another Poisson distribution: Total No. of Sites ~ $Poisson(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{zones}}\lambda_{Ai}^*\frac{A_{Ti}}{A_i})$. </p>

<p><strong>Refinements</strong></p>

<p>The above should get you a decent estimate. However, if your country is small enough that your sample will cover an appreciable portion of the total land area or area within a zone, then you should reduce the total area for each zone by the sampled area in the above formula, so you are modleing the uncertainty on the <em>remaining</em> area (which is actually more accurate in both cases), then you add this uncertainty to your actual counts in the areas you've sampled.</p>

<p>Also, you will notice that you're using a point estimate of $\lambda$.

<p>Efron's ""expected optimism"" is the expected difference between the prediction and training errors. Efron (2004) shows that for a wide range of loss functions (the ""q-family""), and virtually all modeling approaches, the expected optimism in modeling the mean of a vector is proportional to the sum of covariances of fitted and observed components. It thus seems natural that any sensible modeling approach would have non-negative expected optimism (because one tries at least in part to minimize the training error).</p>

<p>I wonder if a more general result exists, though. Suppose that we have an arbitrary optimization criterion (not necessarily a loss in Efron's q-family, maybe not even convex/differentiable/separable; just a function of the data and a tunable parameter). We minimize this criterion on the training data over all possible parameter values in some feasible set. Is the expected minimum obtained this way (where the expectation is taken over all training sets) necessarily an underestimate of the expected criterion value applied to new data, unseen during training (where now the expectation is over all training and all iid testing datasets, as in Efron's definition of optimism)? </p>

<p>In other words, is the expected optimism of a sensible modeling approach always negative? Or maybe one has to really require something of the distribution of the data and/or know something about the criterion?</p>

58541,5821.0,2,,58534.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Your first sentence is not necessarily correct. First off, an increase in numbers of parameters does indeed increase the degrees of freedom and the standard errors of point estimates (hence their degree of generalization). An example of this is the nested classes of Exponential and Weibull models. It's not universally agreed upon that ""model complexity"" necessarily means the parameter space, though, but it is a good place to start for discussion.</p>

<p>Semiparametric and nonparametric inference make overfitting a nonissue by generalizing the likelihood function into a new type of function where such extraneous parameters are ancillary. The only caveat is that the statistician has to correctly identify such models. Examples of such extended likelihoods are conditional likelihood (in mixed modeling), partial likelihood (in Cox models), pseudo likelihood (forgetting some applications for that...), profile likelihood, quasilikelihood, (and the list goes on). The parameter spaces for such likelihoods are seen as <em>projections</em> of high (possibly infinte) dimensional (compact) parameter spaces. </p>

<p>It's only in fully parametric inference where every causal relationship needs to be specified, such as the correlation structure for teeth within a mouth, or the correlation between failure times in a prospective cohort among denominators of individuals counted more than once. Many of these likelihoods are overly complex or intractable hence inference about them is non-existent or otherwise not popular.</p>

<p>Modeling processes is a fully parametric endeavor. You must be able to simulate data from an estimated data generating mechanism. SP/NP often cannot achieve this. Neither can the produce fitted effects nor can they claim to simulate realizations from any data generating process. SP/NP focuses on the point estimation of a specific parameter and efficiently calculates estimates and standard errors for that parameter cancelling out all other parameters in the data generating process through either conditioning, estimating them as nuisance parameters, or some other process.</p>

<p>SP/NP inference examples are the log-rank test (NP), the plain vanilla asymptotic t-test without normality assumptions (NP), conditional logistic regression (SP), generalized estimating equations (GEE), and Cox proportional hazards models (SP).</p>

<p>Examples where semi-parametric inference breaks down is in the case of missing at random data (as opposed to missing completely at random data), where the value of some observed outcome or covariate depends on the things which we deemed to be ancillary (such as informative censoring in Cox models).

  <p>given that people in reality will seldom choose a FPR cut-off of 0.5 or higher, why people would prefer a ROC curve with FPR ranging from 0 to 1 and use the full AUC value (i.e. calculate the entire area under the ROC curve) instead of just reporting the area made from, say, 0 to 0.25 or to 0.5? Is that called ""partial AUC""?</p>

<li>For the same reason, I'm not a big fan of summarizing all that information even further into one single number. But if you have to do so, I agree that it is better to restrict the calculations to parts of the ROC that are relevant for the application. </li>

<p>If you and other experts cannot think of any plausible alternative explanations then it would be rational to decide to continue using tool B.

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> 
Here is a quote from Deming (decide for yourself whether he is a credible source, but he knew both Fisher and J Neyman):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Limitations of statistical inference. All results are conditional on
  (a) the frame whence came the units for test; (b) the method of
  investigation (the questionnaire or the test-method and how it was
  used) ; (c) the people that carry out the interviews or measurements.
  In addition (d), the results of an analytic study are conditional also
  on certain environmental states, such as the geographic locations of
  the comparison, the date and duration of the test, the soil, rainfall,
  climate, description and medical histories of the patients or subjects
  that took part in the test, the observers, the hospital or hospitals,
  duration of test, levels of radiation, range of voltage, speed, range
  of temperature, range of pressure, thickness (as of plating), number
  of flexures, number of jolts, maximum thrust, maximum gust, maximum
  load. </p>
  
  <p>The exact environmental conditions for any experiment will never
  be seen again. Two treatments that show little difference under one
  set of environmental circumstances or even within a range of
  conditions, may differ greatly under other conditions-other soils,
  other climate, etc. The converse may also be true: two treatments that
  show a large difference under one set of conditions may be nearly
  equal under other conditions. </p>
  
  <p>There is no statistical method by which
  to extrapolate to longer usage of a drug beyond the peritd of test,
  nor to other patients, soils, climates, higher voltages, nor to other
  limits of severity outside the range studied. Side effects may develop
  later on. Problems of maintenance of machinery that show up well in a
  test that covers three weeks may cause grief and regret after a few
  months. A competitor may stop in with a new product, or put on a blast
  of advertising. Economic conditions change, and upset predictions and
  plans. These are some of the reasons why information on an analytic
  problem can never be complete, and why computations by use of a
  loss-function can only be conditional. The gap beyond statistical
  inference can be filled in only by knowledge of the subject-matter
  (economics, medicine, chemistry, engineering, psychology, agricultural
  science, etc.), which may take the formality of a model [12], [14],
  [15].</p>

58562,15972.0,2,,58521.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Spotting to add $n$ identical copies of $S_m/S_n$ is very clever! But some of us are not so clever, so it is nice to be able to ""postpone"" the Big Idea to a stage where it is more obvious what to do. Without knowing where to start, there seem be a number of clues that <em>symmetry</em> could be really important (addition is symmetric and we have some summations, and iid variables have the same expectation so maybe they can be swapped around or renamed in useful ways). In fact the ""hard"" bit of this question is how to deal with the division, the operation which <em>isn't</em> symmetric. How can we exploit the symmetry of summation? From linearity of expectation we have:</p>

<p>$\mathbb{E}(S_m/S_n) = \mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_1 + ... + X_m}{X_1 + ... + X_n}\right) = \mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_1}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right) + ... + \mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_m}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right)$</p>

<p>But then on symmetry grounds, given that $X_i$ are iid and $m \le n$, all the terms on the right-hand side are the same! Why? Switch the labels of $X_i$ and $X_j$ for $i, j \le n$. Two terms in the denominator switch position but after reordering it still sums to $S_n$, whereas the numerator changes from $X_i$ to $X_j$. So $\mathbb{E}(X_i/S_n) = \mathbb{E}(X_j/S_n)$. Let's write $\mathbb{E}(X_i/S_n)=k$ for $1 \le i \le n$ and since there are $m$ such terms we have $\mathbb{E}(S_m/S_n) = mk$.</p>

<p>It looks as if $k=1/n$ which would produce the correct result. But how to prove it? We know</p>

<p>$k=\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_1}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right)=\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_2}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right)=...=\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_n}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right)$ </p>

<p>It's only at this stage it dawned on me I should be adding these together, to obtain</p>

<p>$nk = \mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_1}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right) + \mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_2}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right) + ... + \mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_n}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right)$ 
$\implies nk = \mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_1 + ... + X_n}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right) = \mathbb{E}(1) = 1$</p>

<p>What's nice about this method is that it preserves the unity of the two parts of the question. The reason symmetry is broken, requiring adjustment when $m&gt;n$, is that the terms on the right-hand side after applying linearity of expectation will be of two types, depending on whether the $X_i$ in the numerator lies in the sum in the denominator. (As before, I can switch the labels of $X_i$ and $X_j$ if both appear in the denominator as this just reorders the sum $S_n$, or if neither does as this clearly leaves the sum unchanged, but if one does and one doesn't then one of the terms in the denominator changes and it no longer sums to $S_n$.) For $i \le n$ we have $\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_i}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right)=k$ and for $i&gt;n$ we have $\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{X_i}{X_1 + .... + X_n}\right)=r$, say. Since we have $n$ of the former terms, and $m-n$ of the latter,</p>

<p>$\mathbb{E}(S_m/S_n) = nk + (m-n)r = 1 + (m-n)r$</p>

<p>Then finding $r$ is straightforward using independence of $S_n^{-1}$ and $X_i$ for $i&gt;n$: $r=\mathbb{E}(X_i S_n^{-1})=\mathbb{E}(X_i) \mathbb{E}(S_n^{-1})=\mu \mathbb{E}(S_n^{-1})$</p>

<p>So the same ""trick"" works for both parts, it just involves dealing with two cases if $m&gt;n$. I suspect this is why the two parts of the question were given in this order.</p>

58569,16464.0,2,,52567.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>To give an example in line with @neverKnowsBest's response, consider that in a $2^3$ factorial experiment there are 3 factors, each treated as categorical variables with 2 levels, and each possible combination of the factor levels is tested within each replication. If the experiment were only administered once (no replication) this design would require $2^3=8$ runs. The runs can be described by the following 8x3 matrix:
$$
\left[\begin{array}{rr}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\

$$
where the rows represent the runs and the columns represent the levels of the factors: 
$$
\left[\begin{array}{rr}
A &amp; B &amp; C \\
\end{array}
\right].
$$ 
(The first column represents the level of factor A, the second column B, and the third column C). This is referred to as the <strong>Design Matrix</strong> because it describes the design of the experiment. The first run is collected at the 'low' level of all of the factors, the second run is collected at the 'high' level of factor A and the 'low' levels of factors B and C, and so on.</p>

<p>This is contrasted with the model matrix, which if you were evaluating main effects and all possible interactions for the experiment discussed in this post would look like:
$$
\left[\begin{array}{rr}

$$
\left[\begin{array}{rr}
I &amp; A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; AB &amp; AC &amp; BC &amp; ABC \\

<p>I am modeling some data using a random effects logistic regression, more precisely a random intercept logistic regression.

I would like to do some sort of model selection to find the variables that are significant and give the “best” model (main effects only).</p>

<p>My first idea was to use the AIC to compare different models but with 9 variables I was not too exciting to compare 2^9=512 different models (keyword: data dredging).</p>

<p>I discussed this with a colleague and he told me that he remembered reading about using stepwise (or forward) model selection with GLMMs. But instead of using a p-value (e.g. based on a likelihood ratio test for GLMMs), one should use the AIC as entry/exit criterion.</p>

<p>I found this idea very interesting, but I did not find any references that further discussed this and my colleague did not remember where he read it. Many books suggest using the AIC to compare models but I did not find any discussion about using this together with a stepwise or forward model selection procedure.</p>

58578,23205.0,1,,,,random forest classification in R - no separation in training set,<r><classification><random-forest>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Originally posted on Stack Overflow, but suggested to move here...</p>

<p>I'm new to machine learning, but I've tried to perform a Random Forest classification (randomForest package in R) on some metabolomics data with bad results. My normal approach in this case would be to employ a PLS-DA strategy. However, I decided to try both RF and SVM as there are some publications highly recommending these machine learning approaches for Omics data.</p>

<p>In my case, 'X' is a 16*100 data frame (16 individuals with 100 recorded features/predictors) read from a CSV file. 'Y' is a factor vector (length=16) with 8 'high' and 8 'low'. In both PLS-DA and SVM (both linear and radial kernel) I get excellent separation. However, I get 3 misclassifications out of 16 in the RF model.</p>

<p>The RF model looks like: RFA1=randomForest(X,Y)</p>

<pre><code>## read file and fix data frame
in.data = read.csv2(file='Indata.csv', header = FALSE, skip=5)[,-4] # Col 1-3 are identifiers. Features/predictors from col 4
names(in.data)=names(read.csv2(file='Indata.csv',header=T)[,-4])
# str(in.data)
 # $ ID                       : Factor w/ 27 levels ""2"",""3"",""4"",""5"",..: 2 3 4 6 8 10 20 23 5 11 ...
     # $ period                   : Factor w/ 2 levels ""A"",""B"": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 # $ consumption          : Factor w/ 2 levels ""high"",""low"": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 ...
     # $ FEATURES...

## Sort DF into X (features) and Y (classifier based on consumption)
y = in.data$consumption                   # Classifier based on high vs low consumption
x = in.data[,-1:-3]                       # 100 features/predictors into X NB Contains many NAs
nr=nrow(x)
nc=ncol(x)
x.na = as.data.frame(is.na(x))            # Find NAs in X
col.min=apply(x,2,min,na.rm=T)            # Find min value per feature (omitting NAs)
## Deal with zero/missing data-situation
x2=x                                      # Compute new x2 matrix without NA
for (i in 1:nc) {
    x2[x.na[,i],i]=col.min[i]             # Substitute missing data with col.min
}

## Make classifiers according to period (A vs B)
a.ind = in.data$period=='A'
    b.ind = in.data$period=='B'

## Choose data from period A only &amp; transform/scale X
x2a=x2[a.ind,]                 # Original data
x2a.scale=scale(x2a)           # Scaled
x2a.log=log(x2a)               # Log-transformed
x2a.logscale=scale(log(x2a))   # Log-transformed and scaled
ya=y[a.ind]

## Perform analysis for period A
library(randomForest)
(rfa1=randomForest(x2a,ya))
(rfa2=randomForest(x2a.scale,ya))
(rfa3=randomForest(x2a.log,ya))
(rfa4=randomForest(x2a.logscale,ya))
</code></pre>

<p>This generates output like:</p>

<pre><code>Call:
 randomForest(x = x2a, y = ya) 
               Type of random forest: classification
                 Number of trees: 500
No. of variables tried at each split: 10

        OOB estimate of  error rate: 18.75%
Confusion matrix:
     high low class.error
high    6   2       0.250
low     1   7       0.125
</code></pre>

<p>I have played around with both mtry (5-50) and ntree (500-2000) with no apparent success. I've also tried combinations of transforms and scaling of 'X'. But as I understand it, RF is a non-parametric method and as such, transformations and scaling won't do anything for the results.</p>

<p>For comparison, using the exact same data, PLS-DA using SIMCA13 provides excellent separation already in the 1st component. SVM using the kernlab package in R provides 0 training error. At this stage I'm not looking at validation or using test sets. I want to first make sure I get good classification on my training set.</p>

<p>I'm sure I'm missing something, but I don't know what. I hope to have supplied sufficient information to describe the problem.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>

<p>9 IVs is not so very many. Why did you choose those 9? Surely you had a reason.</p>

<p>One initial thing to do is look at a lot of plots; which precise ones depends a little on whether your data are longitudinal (in which case plots with time on the x-axis are often useful) or clustered. But surely look at relationships between the 9 IVs and your DV (parallel box plots are one simple possibility). </p>

<p>The ideal would be to build a few models based on substantive sense and compare them using AIC, BIC or some other measure. But don't be surprised if no particular model comes forth as clearly best. You don't say what field you work in, but in many (most?) fields, nature is complicated. Several models may fit about equally well and a different model may fit better on a different data set (even if both are random samples from the same population).</p>

<p>As for references - there are lots of good books on nonlinear mixed models. Which one is best for you depends on a) What field you are in b) What the nature of the data is c) What software you use. </p>

58699,15827.0,2,,58694.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Your distribution is not beta if your density plot is to be taken at face value. A beta distribution cannot have two modes within (0, 1). However, no density plot for a bounded variable (at a guess here from some kernel density estimation procedure) can be taken at face value unless the estimation includes adjustments for boundary artefacts, which is not typical. But, as it were, we see what you mean. </p>

<p>However, to focus on the major issues: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A regression is first and foremost a model for the mean of a variable as it varies with the predictors. Even if an assumption of normal errors is made, that is <strong>not</strong> an assumption about the marginal distribution of the response and it is the <strong>least important assumption</strong> that is being made. So, it is not surprising that your regression behaves fairly well as far as can be inferred from the distribution of residuals if the functional form catches the way that conditional means behave. </p></li>
<li><p>The assertion of normality is more convincing if you show us a normal probability plot. That distribution looks to me to have higher kurtosis than a normal, although that is likely to be a little deal. </p></li>
<li><p>You need to check that your model is predicting values within [0,1]. Some of your residuals are about 0.7 in magnitude and so it seems possible that some of the predictions are qualitatively wrong. </p></li>
<li><p>At the same time, you should be able to do better with a regression that respects the bounded nature of the response. You could try beta regression or a generalised linear model with binomial family and logit link. The latter sounds wrong but often works well in practice. For a concise introductory review, see <a href=""http://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=st0147"">http://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=st0147</a> Beta regression is supported in R and Stata (and likely so in other software) and generalised linear models are widely supported, although watch for routines that reject non-binary responses if a logit link is requested.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The exact form of your density plot for the response is a side-issue, so I will make this an added note. It's clear that the density for a variable bounded by 0 and 1 must average 1. Your graph has a useful reference line density at 1. Visually comparing the bump above 1 on the left with the area to its right underlines that some of the density has been smoothed away by the procedure beyond the support and discarded. That is, the graph shown truncates the display: the smoothed distribution has positive density below 0 or above 1, which is not shown. There are known ways to smooth a bounded variable more respectfully, in this case including (a) to smooth logit of the variable and back-transform the density (a little problematic if observed values include 0 or 1), or (b) to reflect density inwards at the extremes. Naturally, there is scope for disagreement about whether this is trivial or secondary on the one hand or incorrect on the other. (I'd rather see a quantile plot of the data, but I'll not expand on that.) </p>

Let there be an array (noted as X) where each item has a member, and a label assigned to it. For example:</p>

<p>$$
X= \{a_0, b_0, b_1, c_0, c_1, a_1\}
$$</p>

<p>Here the letter denotes a label, and the index is just another instance from the given label. Now the goal is to sample n items from X into Y, where:</p>

<p>$$
|Y|=n &lt; m = |X|
$$</p>

<p>and each label has a weight assigned to it, so that in the long run the weights will define the distribution of the elements in Y. Elements from within a label are different, but whichever of them may be selected. The multiplicity of the labels are random too (it may vary from 1 to 10). The length of X will be usually around 100, from which around 10 items need to be selected. </p>

<p>So, let's say if the weights are </p>

<p>$$
W = \{a=5, b=45, c=50\} 
$$
for 10,000 runs if we add up the elements from Y it will be true that 5% of it will be from a, 45% from b, and 50% from c. </p>

<p>The indexes just denote that you have multiple item instances from a label. There is no frequency requirement for within label (so simple random sampling can/should be used). </p>

<p>The sampling is without replacement (considering the full array (X), however it is with bounded replacement if you consider just the labels (that is a,b,c labels).</p>

<p>At the end we do not need exact match with W, expected value is okay. Successive runs may result in slightly different output, that too is okay (although the expected value of the frequency of labels, should approximate W).</p>

<p>Brian Joiner claims that ""randomization is not a panacea"". This is contrary to common statements such as the one below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A well-designed experiment includes design features that allow
  researchers to eliminate extraneous variables as an explanation for
  the observed relationship between the independent variable(s) and the
  dependent variable. These extraneous variables are called lurking
  variables.</p>

<a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/32941/examples-of-lurking-variable-and-influential-observation"">Examples of Lurking Variable and Influential Observation</a></p>

<p>One example given is that when testing the safety (specifically carcinogenesis) of red #40 food dye on rodents in the seventies an effect of <strong>cage position</strong> was found to confound the study. Now I have read many journal articles studying carcinogenesis in rodents and have never seen anyone report controlling for this effect.</p>

<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6935460"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A case study of statistics in the regulatory process: the FD&amp;C Red No. 40 experiments.</a></p>

<p>I could not find a non-paywalled version but here is an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the January meeting, we presented a preliminary analysis (14) that
  disclosed a strong correlation between cage row and RE (reticulo-endothelial tumor) death rates,
  which varied from 17% (bottom row) to 32% (top row) (table 2). We
  could not explain this strong association by sex, dosage group, or
  rack column or position. A subsequent analysis (18) also indicated
  that cage position (front vs. back) might be correlated with non-RE
  mortality and that position was correlated with time to non-RE death.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in comments, you need to extend the state. Let $z_t$ consist of pairs of states $(x_t,x_{t-1})$ and now consider a Markov Chain in $z_t$; that is, you have a transition matrix $p(z_t|z_{t-1})$.</p>

<p>So the state at time $t$ will be one of the 16 pairs $(A,A), (A,C) \ldots (G,G)$, and the transition matrix will be a 16 $\times$ 16 matrix of transition probabilities that will be mostly zero (necessarily so, because any pair that doesn't have the second component of $z_t$ match with the first component of $z_{t-1}$ is impossible).</p>

<p>As above, for speed of writing, let's also write $AC$ for $(A,C)$ and so on.</p>

<p>For ease of display I am going to define $z_{t-1}^*$ which is simply a permuted $z_{t-1}$. We can write $p(z_t|z_{t-1}^*)$ and then arrive back at $p(z_t|z_{t-1})$ by simple permutation.</p>

58622,16464.0,1,58902.0,,,Single or Multiple Models for Prediction with Categorical Variable,<regression><categorical-data>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>For a project I need to build a model that can predict batch processing time for the steps in a manufacturing process that are performed on a specific tool type. I know that the processing time is a function of the batch size (number of individual pieces of product loaded into the equipment at once) and the step in question.</p>

<p>I assume that the relationship between processing time and batch size is linear and the data indicate that the relationship is quite different based on which step is being run. In a stylized example where there were two steps run on the equipment under investigation, I've assumed an accurate way to describe the relationship between processing time and batch size is
$$
\mathbf{y=\delta_{0}+\delta_{1}x_{1}+\epsilon}
$$
for step 1 and
$$
\mathbf{y=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}x_{1}+\epsilon}
$$
for step 2, where $\mathbf{\delta}\neq\mathbf{\alpha}$. Segregating the data by step and creating a unique predictive model for each step is less efficient than using an indicator variable to represent the step (with the actual data I have more like 10 steps). Using a model that treated the step as an indicator variable, I would need to specify a model
$$
\mathbf{y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\beta_{3}x_{1}x_{2}+\epsilon}
$$
to accurately capture both models stated above within one model that treated the step as an independent variable.</p>

<p>I thought the larger model might produce predictions identical to the two smaller models but I was unsure because the parameters would be estimated with the 'full' data set in the general case and only a portion of the data set in the case of the smaller models. To test this I created a data set in R:</p>

<p>The results indicate that the larger model is identical to the smaller models in terms of the coefficient estimates. I.e.
$$
\mathbf{\beta_{0}=\delta_{0}} \\
\mathbf{\beta_{1}=\delta_{1}} \\
\mathbf{\beta_{0}+\beta_{2}=\alpha_{0}} \\
\mathbf{\beta_{1}+\beta_{3}=\alpha_{1}} \\
$$
My questions are:</p>

<p>(1) Can anyone explain algebraically how the above is true considering that the parameter estimation equation is:
$$
\mathbf{\hat{\beta}=(X’X)^{-1}X’y}
$$
and neither $\mathbf{X}$ nor $\mathbf{y}$ is the same in either of the three regressions. Obviously the indicator variables must cause the parameter estimation equations to end up being equal but I’d like to know how exactly.</p>

<p>(2) Does this result hold for parameter estimation techniques other than OLS?</p>

<p>(3) Which methodology is considered to be correct within the statistics community and why? Since the predictions from the larger model are identical to the predictions from the smaller models, I know that the residuals for the larger model are just the residuals of both smaller models (In my R example the residuals from the 100 observations used in the larger model are just the residuals from the 50 observations used in each of the smaller models). Consequently, if the regression assumptions are satisfied to a larger extent for data within one step then another it seems that the larger model may balance out the data and appear satisfactory in satisfying the regression assumption, while in fact the data lend themselves to regression analysis for one step but for another step are inconsistent with the use of regression.</p>

In addition, if I just use the amount of networth (raw data) the maximum likelihood estimator doesn't achieve convergence. But, with the Inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformation, the convergence is achieved. My first question is if it is safe to say that we are using the IHS transformation just because we don't have convergence. Are there any other considerations that we need to look into in this regard? Second question is how do we find the scale parameter (theta) in IHS transformation. ?</p>

Dropping is just one way to handle this situation and it is not the only remedy. Sometimes you standardize your independent variables, or get more data (if possible), dropping a term is another option, or even fitting a regression with the knowledge of having Multicollinearity! To assess how much they are correlated, you need to find a factor called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_inflation_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">Variance inflation factor (VIF)</a>, where $VIF(\hat{\beta_j})=\dfrac{1}{1-R^2_i}$ and  $R^2_i$ is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination"" rel=""nofollow"">coefficient of determination</a> of the regression model, i.e. you replace your $Y$ (dependent variable) with $X_i$ and fit your regression model with all other independent variables. Then you find your $R^2$ as usual. The result is denoted by $R^2_i$ to emphasize the fact that you regressed $X_i$ against other independent variables. As a rule of thumb when $VIF(\hat{\beta_j})&gt;5$ (or in some references $VIF(\hat{\beta_j})&gt;10$), we say that multicollinearity is high.     </p>

<p>To answer your 2nd question, just think about the relation between covariance and correlation of two random variables. Then I guess you can find your answer. the correlation is just scaled version of covariance.</p>

<p>For the last question: I don't think there is specific number of variables to call ""too many"" that works in any model. The thing is that you need to fit a good regression model but it does not mean that you should add too many variables. Because over-parametrization is another problem that should be avoided.</p>

<p>This already will give you some sense of which behaviours are clustered together, but you also should check that this isn't plausibly due just to chance.</p>
<p>To check that, I would create simulated data generated by a model under the null hypothesis of no relation. Doing this would require generating data for each behaviour's time from a plausible null model, probably based on resampling the times between each event (eg between each yawn) to create a new set of time stamps for hypothetical null model events. Then calculate the same indicator statistic for this null model and compare to the indicator from your genuine data. By repeating this simulation a number of times, you could find out whether the indicator from your data is sufficiently different from the null model's simulated data (smaller average time from each yawn to the nearest stretch, for example) to count as statistically significant evidence against your null hypothesis.</p>

You have only 98 observations (how are ""yes"" and ""no"" answers distributed?) and more variables than cases. This is a recipe for disaster in the sense that any attempt to build a model with all variables is prone to overfit the data. You will find packages that try to do the trick and some careful cross-validation might help you to avoid some obvious pitfalls, but do not assume that you will learn much on a conceptual level.

It may be that the assumptions about the true parameter values that you made when calculating power are contraindicated by the data, but that does not affect the power as such, since that is specific to the null/alternative hypotheses used in the calculation.  It is important to remember that power calculations take into account the randomness of the sample; in your case, for example, a power calculation based upon a true correlation of 0.5 does not assume that the sample correlation will always be 0.5.  </p>

<p>Consequently, your thinking is correct.  If your assumptions are correct, the test still has 90% power.  As Michael Meyer has pointed out in comments, given your sample size, it is not even the case that your sample correlation indicates that your assumptions are false, which means there isn't any reason to revisit your power calculations.</p>

The retention variable is binary, 'retained' or 'did not retain'. </p>

<p>In 2013 we introduced a new system. Student success advisers were assigned and any student when needed could go to them. We collected some new variables associated with the introduction of the student success advisers together with those collected in 2012. Now, going to these advisers was not mandatory. Those who felt a problem could go to them. </p>

<p>Just looking at 2013 data alone makes it seem that the advisers make things worse: the students they see do worse, and are more likely to leave university. Only the students who faced problems probably went to the advisers and those who were doing well probably didn't. If 10 students went to the advisers with problems and 8 retained to semester 2, that is surely a success. But if 80 out of 100 students who didn't have any problem and thus didn't go to the adviser retained to semester 2, that will have log odds similar to those who went to the advisers and thus tell you that going to the advisers had no significant effect!</p>

<p>Part of the reason was a major policy change that affected how universities in our country took in students.  There was a ""cap"" in place before 2013, a limit on how many students a university could take on and expect government funding for.  In 2013 that was removed.  So, successful, desirable universities started opening their doors to more students, and more students were able, suddenly, to get into desirable universities. Our university is not so desirable. So what probably happened was that our university was forced in 2013 to take significantly ""worse"" students, which could well lead to greater retention difficulty. </p>

<p>What my bosses think is that we need to weight the 2012 data so that it matches the 2013 data on some of the variables that may have been sensitive to the removal of the cap on student entry (or weight the 2013 data so that it matches the 2012 data).  Then we can compare two different cohorts as if they were a proper control group for each other.  In fact, this is illusory. Some suggested using SPSSINC RAKE, but I am not getting any clue why.</p>

<p>What we want to find out (very broadly) is whether introducing the advisers etc. worked, and the degree to which it worked. </p>

[Edit in response to comment: The answer is that a single person can only have one level of a categorical predictor, &amp; you'll never be interested in predicting the response for someone with more than one level, so it's to be expected that there's correlation between the levels, &amp; poses no problem at all.

As a result, the prediction vs. actual plot can't lie on the 45-degree line passing through 0; if it did, the variance of the target variable would be equal to the variance of the model, and there would be no room left for residual variance.</p>

<p>Here are four plots to illustrate this point with linear regression.  In the first one, the error variance is relatively high, and, as a consequence, the predicted - vs - actual plot isn't anywhere near the diagonal line.  In the second through fourth, the error variance is much lower, and the predicted - vs - actual plot gets much closer to the diagonal line.</p>

<p>First, the code:</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- rnorm(1000)
y &lt;- x + rnorm(1000,0,2) # rnorm(1000,0,1), rnorm(1000,0,0.5), rnorm(1000,0,0.1) 

plotlim &lt;- range(y)

<p>Consequently, there's no need to alter your fitting procedure or augment your model.</p>

<p>Further heuristic explanation: Note that this comes about because $\sigma^2_Y &gt; \sigma^2_X$, in this particular linear regression model.  Therefore, even with the true parameter values (in this case, 0 intercept and 1 slope), the plot of $Y$ will be more spread out than the plot of $X$, and, since the estimated values of $Y$ with the true parameter values will equal $X$, it will also be the case that the plot of $Y$ will be more spread out than the plot of the estimated values of $Y$.  As a result, the estimated values vs. true values plot will not lie on a 45-degree line.</p>

58659,668.0,2,,14729.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>The question asks about ""identifying underlying [linear] relationships"" among variables.</p>

<p><strong>The quick and easy way to <em>detect</em> relationships</strong> is to regress any other variable (use a constant, even) against those variables using your favorite software: any good regression procedure will detect and diagnose collinearity.  (You will not even bother to look at the regression results: we're just relying on a useful side-effect of setting up and analyzing the regression matrix.)</p>

<p>Assuming collinearity is detected, though, what next?  <strong>Principal Components Analysis</strong> (PCA) is exactly what is needed: its <em>smallest</em> components correspond to near-linear relations.  These relations can be read directly off the ""loadings,"" which are linear combinations of the original variables.  Small loadings (that is, those associated with small eigenvalues) correspond to near-collinearities.  An eigenvalue of $0$ would correspond to a perfect linear relation.  Slightly larger eigenvalues that are still much smaller than the largest would correspond to approximate linear relations.</p>

<p>(There is an art and quite a lot of literature associated with identifying what a ""small"" loading is.  For modeling a dependent variable, I would suggest including it within the independent variables in the PCA in order to identify the components--regardless of their sizes--in which the dependent variable plays an important role.  From this point of view, ""small"" means much smaller than any such component.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Let's look at some examples.</strong>  (These use <code>R</code> for the calculations and plotting.)  Begin with a function to perform PCA, look for small components, plot them, and return the linear relations among them. </p>

<pre class=""lang-R prettyprint-override""><code>pca &lt;- function(x, threshold, ...) {

  return(t(relations))
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's apply this to some random data.  These are built on four variables (the $B,C,D,$ and $E$ of the question).  Here is a little function to compute $A$ as a given linear combination of the others.  It then adds i.i.d. Normally-distributed values to all five variables (to see how well the procedure performs when multicollinearity is only approximate and not exact).</p>

<pre class=""lang-R prettyprint-override""><code>process &lt;- function(z, beta, sd, ...) {
  x &lt;- z %*% beta; colnames(x) &lt;- ""A""
  pca(cbind(x, z + rnorm(length(x), sd=sd)), ...)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We're all set to go: it remains only to generate $B, \ldots, E$ and apply these procedures.  I use the two scenarios described in the question: $A=B+C+D+E$ (plus some error in each) and $A=B+(C+D)/2+E$ (plus some error in each).  First, however, note that PCA is almost always applied to <em>centered</em> data, so these simulated data are centered (but not otherwise rescaled) using <code>sweep</code>.</p>

<pre class=""lang-R prettyprint-override""><code>n.obs &lt;- 80 # Number of cases

z &lt;- sweep(z, 2, z.mean)

</code></pre>

<p>Here we go with two scenarios and three levels of error applied to each.  The original variables $B, \ldots, E$ are retained throughout without change: only $A$ and the error terms vary.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0yXVh.png"" alt=""Results""></p>

<p>The output associated with the upper left panel was</p>

<pre><code>       A  B  C  D  E
Comp.5 1 -1 -1 -1 -1
</code></pre>

<p>This says that the row of red dots--which is constantly at $0$, demonstrating a <em>perfect</em> multicollinearity--consists of the combination $0 \approx A -B-C-D-E$: exactly what was specified.</p>

<p>The output for the upper middle panel was</p>

<pre><code>       A     B     C     D     E
Comp.5 1 -0.95 -1.03 -0.98 -1.02
</code></pre>

<p>The coefficients are still close to what we expected, but they are not quite the same due to the error introduced.  It thickened the four-dimensional hyperplane within the five-dimensional space implied by $(A,B,C,D,E)$ and that tilted the estimated direction just a little.  With more error, the thickening becomes comparable to the original spread of the points, making the hyperplane almost impossible to estimate.  Now (in the upper right panel) the coefficients are</p>

<pre><code>       A     B     C     D     E
Comp.5 1 -1.33 -0.77 -0.74 -1.07
</code></pre>

<p>They have changed quite a bit but still reflect the basic underlying relationship $A' = B' + C' + D' + E'$ where the primes denote the values with the (unknown) error removed.</p>

<p>The bottom row is interpreted the same way and its output similarly reflects the coefficients $1, 1/2, 1/2, 1$.</p>

<p>In practice, it is often not the case that one variable is singled out as an obvious combination of the others: all coefficients may be of comparable sizes and of varying signs.  Moreover, when there is more than one dimension of relations, there is no unique way to specify them: further analysis (such as row reduction) is needed to identify a useful basis for those relations. That's how the world works: <strong>all you can say is that <em>these</em> particular combinations that are output by PCA correspond to almost no variation in the data.</strong>  To cope with this, some people use the largest (""principal"") components directly as the independent variables in the regression or the subsequent analysis, whatever form it might take.  If you do this, do not forget first to remove the dependent variable from the set of variables and redo the PCA!</p>

<p>Here is the code to reproduce this figure:</p>

58666,17573.0,2,,58070.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Sorry about the delay in answering.  What's going on, I think, is seasonality.  </p>

<p>Suppose there are three temperatures.  First there is ""true"" temperature---whatever average high surface air temperature actually occurs on each day.  Second, there is ground measured temperature.  Third, there is satellite measured temperature.  The second and third temperatures are the first temperature, except measured with error.  Like this:
\begin{align}
\textrm{ground}_{d,y} &amp;= \textrm{true}_{d,y} + \nu_{d,y}\\
\textrm{satellite}_{d,y} &amp;= \textrm{true}_{d,y} + \eta_{d,y}\\
\end{align}</p>

<p>Above, $\mathrm{true}_{d,y}$ means the true temperature in year $y$ on day $d$, where day counts up from 1 on 01/01/year to 365 on 12/31/year --- I am too lazy to think about leap years here.</p>

<p>Now, if you regress ground on satellite, of course you are going to get a regression with some predictive power, because both measurements are being driven by the same true temperature.  However, the predictive power will not be perfect.  How good will the predictions be?  Well, that depends on the ratio of signal (variance of movements in true temperature) to noise (variance of movements in $\nu$ and $\eta$.  In fact, you can calculate the covariance and correlation between ground and satellite (assuming that the $\nu$ and $\eta$ are iid, independent of each other, and independent of true):
\begin{align}
Cov(\mathrm{ground},\mathrm{satellite}) &amp;= V(\mathrm{true})\\
Corr(\mathrm{ground},\mathrm{satellite}) &amp;= \frac{V(\mathrm{true})}
               {\sqrt{(V(\mathrm{true})+V(\nu))(V(\mathrm{true})+V(\eta))}}
\end{align}</p>

<p>Now, in the simple bivariate model, when you just regress ground on satellite, $R^2$ is equal to the correlation above squared, or:
\begin{align}
R^2 &amp;= \frac{(V(\mathrm{true}))^2}
               {(V(\mathrm{true})+V(\nu))(V(\mathrm{true})+V(\eta))}
\end{align}</p>

<p>So, why is $R^2$ so much higher in the Nov to Apr sample than in the Jan sample?  That's easy.  As long as you are looking at a weather station far from the equator, there are big month-to-month differences in true.  So, the more of the year you include in your time window, the higher is $V(\mathrm{true})$, and the higher is $R^2$.</p>

<p>Why, then, is the mean of the sum of squared residuals higher in the Nov to Apr sample than in the Jan sample?  The mean of the sum of squared residuals goes in probability to:
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{n}\sum e_i^2 &amp;\rightarrow V(\mathrm{ground}) + \beta^2 V(\mathrm{satellite})
\end{align}</p>

<p>The $\beta$ in the above is the probability limit of the regression coefficient.  Notice that this quantity goes up as the variance of both ground and satellite go up.  As you expand your time window from Jan only to Nov through Apr, the variance of true goes up and this drives the variance of both ground and satellite up.  In turn, this drives the variance of the residuals up.</p>

<p>If you prefer a numerical example, here is some R code where you can see what is going on.  All I have done is implement the reasoning above in a very simple monte carlo.  As you can see if you run the code, I have pretty well replicated your $R^2$ and mean squared residual results using somewhat realistic temperature data:</p>

# The program is a toy monte carlo.
# It generates a ""true"" but unobservable-to-the-analyst high temperature series
# in degrees Celcius for a location in the northern hemisphere of the earth 
# pretty far from the equator.  It is very loosely based on Des Moines, IA.
# The series simulates seasonality with a sinusoidal curve and generates

# Then it generates two series which measure the true temperature with error,
# calling them satellite and ground.  Then it regresses ground on satellite 
# by OLS over various slices of the data.  The slices are only January,
# only Nov through Apr, and all year long.

# day is days since 12/31/1979, ie it starts at 1 on 01/01/1980

<p>Obviously, in your application there is a lot more going on since you have other right-hand-side variables in your analysis.  Also, the measurement errors are probably not nice, normally distributed, iid things like in the monte carlo.  Nevertheless, I think what is going on in your data is likely to be what is going on in this monte carlo.  In conclusion, I don't think your results are anything to worry about.  They are exactly what we would expect in this circumstance.</p>

<p>One could maybe add that the real importance of this different modes of convergence lies in the mathematics, that they permit the use of different <strong>mathematical</strong> techniques, in the development of the theory, only.

58668,668.0,2,,58662.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_expectation#Formal_definition"">formal definition of conditional expectation</a> is that $E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1]$ is any <em>random variable</em> measurable with respect to $\mathcal{F}_1$ having the property that</p>

<p>$$\int_F E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1](\omega)d\mathbb{P}(\omega) = \int_F Y(\omega) d\mathbb{P}(\omega)$$</p>

<p>for all $\mathcal{F}_1$-measurable sets $F$.</p>

<p>In the present case, this definition invites us to inspect all the measurable subsets $F$ with respect to $\mathcal{F}_1$, which you already computed in the first problem.  The trick is to <strong>begin with the smallest, most basic $\mathcal{F}_1$-measurable sets</strong> (apart from the empty set), which are $\{HH, HT\}$ and $\{TH, TT\}$.  Although we don't yet know  $E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1]$, we can use the right hand side to compute its integrals.  Because neither of these events can be decomposed (nontrivially) into smaller ones, <em>the conditional expectation must have a constant value on each one.</em>  For example, writing 
$$E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1](HH) =E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1](HT) = z,$$</p>

<p>the definition gives</p>

<p>$$\eqalign{
zp &amp;= zp^2 + zp(1-p) \\
&amp;=E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1](HH) \mathbb{P}(HH) +E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1](HT) \mathbb{P}(HT)\\
&amp;=\int_{\{HH, HT\}} E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1](\omega)d\mathbb{P}(\omega)\\
&amp;= \int_{\{HH, HT\}} Y(\omega) d\mathbb{P}(\omega)\\
&amp;= Y(HH)\mathbb{P}(HH) + Y(HT)\mathbb{P}(HT) \\
&amp;= 2p^2 + 1p(1-p)= p+p^2,
}$$</p>

<p>whence we deduce</p>

<p>$$z = \frac{p+p^2}{p} = 1 + p.$$</p>

<p>A similar calculation for $F = \{TH, TT\}$ (do it!) establishes that</p>

<p>$$E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1](TH) =E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1](TT) = p.$$</p>

<p><strong>There is a simple intuition</strong> to support these abstract calculations: $\mathcal{F}_1$ records the information available after flipping the coin the first time.  If it comes up heads, the possible events (which have only partially occurred!) are $HH$ and $HT$.  We already have one head and there is a chance $p$ that the second flip will be a head.  Thus, <em>at this stage,</em> our expectation of $Y$ equals $1$ (for what has happened) plus $1\times p$ (for what <em>could</em> happen yet), summing to $1+p$.  If instead the first flip is tails, we have seen no heads yet but there is still a chance of $p$ of seeing a head on the second flip: the expectation of $Y$ is just $0 + 1\times p = p$ in that case.</p>

<p>As a check, we can compute </p>

<p>$$\eqalign{
E[E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1]] &amp;= \int_\Omega E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1](\omega)d\mathbb{P}(\omega) \\
&amp;= (1+p)\mathbb{P}(E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1]=1+p) + (p)\mathbb{P}(E[Y|\mathcal{F}_1]=p)\\
&amp; = (1+p)\mathbb{P}(\{HH, HT\}) + (p) \mathbb{P}(\{TH, TT\})\\
&amp;= (1+p)(p^2 + p(1-p)) + p((1-p)p + (1-p)^2)\\
&amp;= 2p,
}$$</p>

<p>exactly as before.</p>

<p>It should be clear that this is just a laborious way of expressing the idea that there is a $p$ chance at the outset of heads--which has a conditional expectation of $1+p$-- and a $1-p$ chance of tails--which has a conditional expectation of $p$: everything reduces to the elementary calculation of conditional expectations, which needs no sigma fields or integrals.  The point of this exercise is to build on that intuition to develop an understanding that will hold up when these sigma algebras get much, much more complicated.</p>

58672,3993.0,2,,58627.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>It seems to me that Ellis could be referring to as many as three distinct ideas here. First he says something about creating ""simulated data generated by a model under the null hypothesis of no relation."" I would call this a form of <strong>parametric bootstrapping</strong>. Then he says that this would be ""probably based on resampling the times between each event (eg between each yawn) to create a new set of time stamps for hypothetical null model events."" Which, let's just be clear here, to do this is <em>not</em> to ""create simulated data."" We are instead, if I understand correctly, resampling from our actually observed data. This latter procedure is either a <strong>permutation test</strong> or <strong>nonparametric bootstrapping</strong>, depending on how the resampling takes place.</p>

<p>I guess I should say a few more words about parametric bootstrapping, permutation tests, and nonparametric bootstrapping.</p>

<p>Usually parametric bootstrapping is done by simulating based on the actually estimated model, and not based on a hypothetical model that is just like the estimated model except the null hypothesis is assumed true, as Ellis seems to suggest at first. By ""simulate data"" I mean something like as an example: my model states that my data come from two groups, each with a normal distribution, with means $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, respectively, and standard deviation $\sigma$, so I will generate many sets of data that satisfy this and use the distribution of test statistics computed from each of these simulated datasets as my sampling distribution. Note, I am creating this data using something like <code>rnorm()</code> in <code>R</code>, <em>not</em> directly using my observed data. Now, one could certainly do this procedure and get a sort of sampling distribution under the null hypothesis of, say, no difference in group means--we would just assume $\mu_1=\mu_2$ in all the simulated datasets, contrary to what we actually observed--and in this way we get a bootstrapped p-value (rather than a bootstrapped confidence interval, which is what the former/traditional method affords you). Again, I would just call this a way of obtaining a p-value via parametric bootstrapping.</p>

<p>A permutation test, on the other hand, involves shuffling your observed data over and over in a way that would be consistent with the null hypothesis. So for example, if the null hypothesis implies that group assignment makes no difference in terms of the group means, you can randomly shuffle the group labels among all your observations many many times and see what mean differences you would get for all possible ways of shuffling in this way. And then you would see where within the distribution of test statistics computed from these shuffled datasets does your actual observed statistic lie. Note that there is a finite (but usually large) number of ways that you can shuffle your actually observed data.</p>

<p>Finally, nonparametric bootstrapping is very similar to the permutation test, but we resample the observed data <em>with replacement</em> to try to get closer to an infinite ""population"" of values that our data might have been drawn from. There are many, many more ways to resample from your data with replacement than there are to shuffle your data (although it is technically finite in practice as well). Again, similar to parametric bootstrapping, this is usually done not under the null hypothesis, but under the model implied by the observed data, yielding confidence intervals around the observed test statistics, not p-values. But one could certainly imagine doing this under the null hypothesis like Ellis suggests and obtaining p-values in this way. As an example of nonparametric bootstrapping here (in the traditional fashion, i.e., <em>not</em> under the null hypothesis) using the same difference-in-group-means example I used in the parametric bootstrapping paragraph, to do this we would resample with replacement the observations within each group many times <em>but not mixing observations between groups</em> (unlike in the permutation test), and build up the sampling distribution of group mean differences that we get this way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the finest fruits of the Fisherian revolution was the idea of
  randomization, and statisticians who agree on few other things have at
  least agreed on this. But despite this agreement and despite the
  widespread use of randomized allocation procedures in clinical and in
  other forms of experimentation, its logical status, i.e., the exact
  function it performs, is still obscure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cornfield, Jerome (1976). <a href=""http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/PDF%20bg/Cornfield%20J%201976%20recent%20methodological%20contributions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Recent Methodological Contributions to Clinical Trials""</a>. American Journal of Epidemiology 104 (4): 408–421.</p>

<p>Throughout this site and in a variety of literature I consistently see confident claims about the powers of randomization. Strong terminology such as ""it <strong>eliminates</strong> the issue of confounding variables"" are common. See <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/32941/examples-of-lurking-variable-and-influential-observation"">here</a>, for example. However, many times experiments are run with small samples (3-10 samples per group) for practical/ethical reasons. This is very common in preclinical research using animals and cell cultures and the researchers commonly report p values in support of their conclusions.</p>

<p>This got me wondering, how good is randomization at balancing confounds. For this plot I modeled a situation comparing treatment and control groups with one confound that could take on two values with 50/50 chance (eg type1/type2, male/female). It shows the distribution of ""% Unbalanced"" (Difference in # of type1 between treatment and control samples divided by sample size) for studies of a variety of small sample sizes. The red lines and right side axes show the ecdf.</p>

<p><strong>Probability of various degrees of balance under randomization for small sample sizes:</strong>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H3n20.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Two things are clear from this plot (unless I messed up somewhere).</p>

<p>1) The probability of getting exactly balanced samples decreases as sample size is increased.</p>

<p>2) The probability of getting a very unbalanced sample decreases as sample size increases.</p>

<p>3) In the case of n=3 for both groups, there is a 3% chance of getting a completely unbalanced set of groups (all type1 in the control, all type2 in the treatment). N=3 is common for molecular biology experiments (eg  measure mRNA with PCR, or proteins with western blot)</p>

<p>When I examined the n=3 case further, I observed strange behaviour of the p values under these conditions. The left side shows the overall distribution of pvalues calculating using t-tests under conditions of different means for the type2 subgroup. The mean for type1 was 0, and sd=1 for both groups. The right panels show the corresponding false positive rates for nominal ""significance cutoffs"" from .05 to.0001.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution of p-values for n=3 with two subgroups and different means of the second subgroup when compared via t test (10000 monte carlo runs):</strong>

<p>As can be seen from the charts above there appears to be an interaction between sample size and difference between subgroups that results in a variety of p-value distributions under the null hypothesis that are not uniform.</p>

58680,1145.0,2,,58678.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>You are correct to point out the limitations of randomisation in dealing with unknown confounding variables for very small samples. However, the problem is not that the P-values are not reliable, but that their meaning varies with sample size and with the relationship between the assumptions of the method and the actual properties of the populations.</p>

<p>My take on your results is that the P-values performed quite well until the difference in the subgroup means was so large that any sensible experimenter would know that there was an issue prior to doing the experiment. </p>

<p>The idea that an experiment can be done and analysed without reference to a proper understanding of the nature of the data is mistaken. Before analysing a small dataset you must know enough about the data to be able to confidently defend the assumptions implicit in the analysis.

58681,3993.0,2,,58296.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Here is another geometric view of suppression, but rather than being in the <em>observation space</em> as @ttnphns's example is, this one is in the <em>variable space</em>, the space where everyday scatterplots live.</p>

<p>Consider a regression $\hat{y}_i=x_i+z_i$, that is, the intercept is 0 and both predictors have a partial slope of 1. Now, the predictors $x$ and $z$ may themselves be correlated. We will consider two cases: first the case where $x$ and $z$ are positively correlated, which I will call the ""confounding"" case (characterized by the secondary regression $\hat{x}_i=\frac{1}{2}z_i$), and second the case where $x$ and $z$ are negatively correlated, which I will call the ""suppression"" case (with secondary regression $\hat{x}_i=-\frac{1}{2}z_i$).</p>

<p>We can plot our regression equation as a plane in the variable space that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SrKCR.png"" alt=""plane""></p>

<h1>Confounding case</h1>

<p>Let's consider the slope for the $x$ predictor in the confounding case. To say that the other predictor $z$ is serving as a confounding variable is to say that when we look at a simple regression of $y$ on $x$, the effect of $x$ here is <em>stronger</em> than is the effect of x in a multiple regression of $y$ on $x$ and $z$, where we partial out the effect of $z$. The effect of $x$ that we observe in the simple regression is, in some sense (not necessarily causal), partially due to the effect of $z$, which is positively associated with both $y$ and $x$, but not included in the regression. (For the purposes of this answer I will use ""the effect of $x$"" to refer to the slope of $x$.)</p>

<p>We will call the slope of $x$ in the simple linear regression the ""simple slope"" of $x$ and the slope of $x$ in the multiple regression the ""partial slope"" of $x$. Here is what the simple and partial slopes of $x$ look like as vectors on the regression plane:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3pIks.png"" alt=""confounding""></p>

<p>The partial slope of x is perhaps easier to understand. It is shown in red above. It is the slope of a vector that moves along the plane in such a way that $x$ is increasing, but $z$ is held constant. This is what it means to ""control for"" $z$.</p>

<p>The simple slope of $x$ is slightly more complicated because it implicitly also includes part of the effect of the $z$ predictor. It is shown in blue above. The simple slope of $x$ is the slope of a vector that moves along the plane in such a way that $x$ is increasing, and <em>$z$ also is increasing (or decreasing) to whatever extent $x$ and $z$ are associated in the dataset</em>. In the confounding case, we set things up so that the relationship between $x$ and $z$ was such that when we move up one unit on $x$, we also move up half a unit on $z$ (this comes from the secondary regression $\hat{x}_i=\frac{1}{2}z_i$). And since one-unit changes in both $x$ and $z$ are separately associated with one-unit changes in $y$, this means that the simple slope of $x$ in this case will be $\Delta x + \Delta z = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 1.5$.</p>

<p>So when we control for $z$ in the multiple regression, the effect of $x$ appears to be smaller than it was in the simple regression. We can see this visually above in the fact that the red vector (representing the partial slope) is <em>less steep</em> than the blue vector (representing the simple slope). The blue vector is really the result of adding two vectors, the red vector and another vector (not shown) representing the <em>half</em> the partial slope of $z$.</p>

<p>Okay, now we turn to the slope for the $x$ predictor in the suppression case. If you followed all of the above, this is a really easy extension.</p>

<h1>Suppression case</h1>

<p>To say that the other predictor $z$ is serving as a supressor variable is to say that when we look at a simple regression of $y$ on $x$, the effect of $x$ here is <em>weaker</em> than is the effect of x in a multiple regression of $y$ on $x$ and $z$, where we partial out the effect of $z$. (Note that in extreme cases, the effect of $x$ in the multiple regression might even <em>flip directions!</em> But I am not considering that extreme case here.) The intution behind the terminology is that it appears that in the simple regression case, the effect of $x$ was being ""suppressed"" by the omitted $z$ variable. And when we include $z$ in the regression, the effect of $x$ emerges clearly for us to see, where we couldn't see it as clearly before. Here is what the simple and partial slopes of $x$ look like as vectors on the regression plane in the suppression case:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NzWsa.png"" alt=""suppression""></p>

<p>So when we control for $z$ in the multiple regression, the effect of $x$ appears to <em>increase</em> relative to what it was in the simple regression. We can see this visually above in the fact that the red vector (representing the partial slope) is <em>steeper</em> than the blue vector (representing the simple slope). In this case the secondary regression was $\hat{x}_i=-\frac{1}{2}z_i$, so a one-unit increase in $x$ is associated with a half-unit <em>decrease</em> in $z$, which in turn leads to a half-unit decrease in $y$. So ultimately the simple slope of $x$ in this case will be $\Delta x + \Delta z = 1 + -\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$. As before, the blue vector is really the result of adding two vectors, the red vector and another vector (not shown) representing <em>half</em> of the <em>reverse</em> of the partial slope of $z$.</p>

<p>Moreover, I understand that this is not a supply-demand interaction framework, since it seems that you change prices and then ""wait to see what happens"", fulfilling whatever demand appears. Given these preliminaries:</p>

<p>$1$) The fact that people may exhibit some degree of inertia is an integral part of their behavior, so trying to ""eliminate"" it is not useful since what you will then be estimating would perhaps be the ""true"" price elasticity of demand, but one which will never materialize, since inertia will always be present, and will affect the total demand response.

<p>What you need is to obtain a separate estimate of <em>both</em> effects. This calls for a  specification like the following:</p>

The estimate $\hat b$ will be the estimated average price elasticity of demand, ""cleansed"" from any inertia effects and other ""random"" factors.  </p>

58684,16464.0,2,,14729.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Not that the answer @Whuber gave really needs to be expanded on but I thought I'd provide a brief description of the math.</p>

<p>If the linear combination $\mathbf{X'Xv}=\mathbf{0}$ for $\mathbf{v}\neq\mathbf{0}$ then $\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector of $\mathbf{X'X}$ associated with eigenvalue $\lambda=0$. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\mathbf{X'X}$ are also the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\mathbf{X}$, so the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{X'X}$ associated with eigenvalues near $\lambda=0$ represent the coefficients for approximate linear relationships among the regressors. Principal Component Analysis outputs the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\mathbf{X'X}$, so you can use the eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}$ associated with small $\lambda$ to determine if linear relationships exist among some of your regressors.</p>

<p>One method of determining if an eigenvalue is appropriately small to constitute collinearity is to use the Condition Indices:
$$
\mathbf{\kappa_j}=\frac{\lambda_{max}}{\lambda_j}
$$
which measures the size of the smallest eigenvalues relative to the largest. A general rule of thumb is that modest multicollinearity is associated with a condition index between 100 and 1,000 while severe multicollinearity is associated with a condition index above 1,000 (Montgomery, 2009). </p>

<p>It's important to use an appropriate method for determining if an eigenvalue is small because it's not the absolute size of the eigenvalues, it's the relative size of the condition index that's important, as can be seen in an example. Consider the matrix
$$
\mathbf{X'X}=\left[\begin{array}{rr}
0.001 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0.001 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.001 \\
\end{array}
\right].
$$
The eigenvalues for this matrix are $\lambda_1=\lambda_2=\lambda_3=0.001$. Although these eigenvalues appear small the condition index is
$$
\mathbf{\kappa}=\frac{\lambda_{max}}{\lambda_{min}}=1
$$
indicating absence of multicolinearity and , in fact, the columns of this matrix are linearly independent.</p>

They were initially implemented to detect manufacturing defects by testing for significant thresholds in greyscale image pixel intensities however they are decent at detecting thresholds in any histogram.  They do so by identifying the threshold(s) that maximize the across class variance or minimize the within class variance of the data. Both papers are attached <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/nqebqrg8o3x05nr/Archive.zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>NG's approach is a simple extension that adds what the author describes as a valley finding modification.  It simply multiplies the across class variance of any possible threshold by 1 minus the probability of an observation at the threshold. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>An indicator wide sense is anything that indicates (i.e. is considered revealing or diagnostic), which could be any counted or measured variable. Consider statements such as that unemployment rate, GDP growth and government debt are good indicators of the state of an economy. In contrast, an indicator precise sense indicates the state of a binary or dichotomous variable (e.g. survived vs not, alive vs dead, present vs absent, male vs female) by 1 or 0. Often, which state is coded 1 and which is 0 is a matter of convention or convenience, as in the case of male or female. Indicator variables are perhaps more often called dummy variables in several fields of statistical science, although that term on occasion has been misread as offensive. </p></li>
<li><p>An index is sometimes a scaled composite variable: for example, a price index or wages index is based on a weighted sum of prices or wages, often scaled so it is 100 in some base year or at some base time. An index is also sometimes any kind of summary measure designed to capture some property (segregation, diversity, whatever) in a single number. Ideally, it is recognised whenever one index is used that others are also possible.</p></li>
<li><p>A variable varies, or at least in principle might vary. It is difficult to say more if that is unclear, except by contrast: anything defined to be constant cannot be a variable. Statistics makes enormous play, however, with parameters which are constant in a given situation but variable from situation to situation. So, mean temperature and the slope of a regression line are parameters. </p></li>
<li><p>A measure may or should be something with a strict definition in measure theory (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory</a>), but either you know that already or it is irrelevant to you. At elementary or introductory or lay level, it might just be yet another word for anything you (count or) measure (e.g. one measure of diversity in ecology is just the number of species present at a site). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think any of these terms is really difficult -- at the level I have chosen here -- and any good dictionary should provide authority if you need it. That said, there are numerous formal accounts or theories of measurement, which do not all agree on terminology or definitions. </p>

58702,13202.0,1,58884.0,,,PCA and PLS: testing variables for significance,<statistical-significance><pca><partial-least-squares>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I'm trying to understand the process for statistical testing for principal component analysis or partial least squares.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1. PCA:</strong>
I feel that I have a not-terrible understanding of PCA: You find the ellipsoid described by the covariance matrix of the data, and then successively take the largest axis of variation (principal component 1), then the second largest (principal component 2), and so on. If the ellipsoid is long and stretched, then the variation is mostly along the first principal component (the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the ellipsoid). If the ellipsoid is a planar ""disc"", then the variation in the data is explained well by two principal components, etc.</p>

<p>I also understand that after choosing to use (for example) only the first two principal components, then all of the data points can be plotted on a ""Scores"" plot that shows, for each data point $D^{(i)}$, the projection of $D^{(i)}$ into the plane spanned by the first two principal components. Likewise, for the ""Loadings"" plot (I think) you write the first and second principal components as linear combinations of the input variables and then for each variable, plot the coefficients that it contributes to the first and second principal components.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2. PLS or PLS-DA:</strong>
If there are labels on the data (let's say binary classes), then build a linear regression model to use the first and second principal components to discriminate class 0 (for data point $i$, that means $Y^{(i)}=0$) from class 1 (for data point $i$, that means $Y^{(i)}=1$) by first projecting all data to only lie in the plane spanned by the first and second principal components, and then regressing the projected input data $X_1', X_2'$ to $Y$. This regression could be written as (first step) the affine transformation (i.e. linear transformation + bias) that projects along $PC_1, PC_2$ (the first and second principal components), and then (second step) a second affine transformation that predicts $Y$ from $PC_1, PC_2$. Together these transformations $Y \approx Affine(Affine(X))$ can be written as a single affine transformation $Y \approx C (A X + B) + D = E X + F$. </p>

<p><strong>Step 3. Testing variables from $X$ for significance in predicting the class $Y$:</strong>
This is where I could use some help (unless I'm way off already, in which case tell me!). How do you test whether an input variable (i.e. a feature that has not yet been projected onto the principal components (hyper)plane), and decide if it has a statistically significant coefficient in the regression $Y \approx E X + F$? Qualitatively, a coefficient in $E$ that is further from zero (i.e. positive and negative values with large magnitude) indicates a larger contribution from that variable.</p>

<p>I remember seeing linear regression t-tests for normally distributed data (to test whether the coefficients were zero). Is this the standard approach? In that case, I would guess that ever variable from $X$ has been transformed to have a roughly normal distribution in Step 0 (i.e. before any of these other steps are performed).</p>

<p>Otherwise, I could see performing a permutation test (by running this entire procedure thousands of times and each time permuting $Y$ to shuffle the labels, and then comparing each single coefficient in $E$ from the un-shuffled analysis to the distribution of coefficients from shuffled analyses).</p>

<p>Can you help me see anywhere my intuition is failing? I've been trying to look through papers using similar procedures to see what they did, and as is often the case, they're clear as mud. I'm preparing a tutorial for some other researchers, and I want to do a good job. </p>

<p>$P(Z\leq z) = P(X+c\leq z) = P(X\leq z-c) = F_X(z-c); a\leq z-c\leq b$.</p>

<p>If you know it, you just start by writing down the cdf; then $P(X≤z−c)$ simply requires substitution, not integration.

58706,17740.0,2,,58435.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>This is one of the generalizations of classification that are tackled in semi-supervised learning. If you have a measurement of certainty you can use approaches that allow weighting of training instances. The higher the certainty, the larger the corresponding instance weight. Examples of such approaches include instance-weighted SVM and logistic regression. </p>

<p>I'm sure weka has implementations of these algorithms. If all else fails, sample multiple instances from the instances with high certainty. You can use this approach for traditional SVM or LR.</p>

<h3>Example: SVM</h3>

<p>If I am not mistaken, weka has interfaces to <a href=""http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/"">LIBSVM</a>. LIBSVM allows you to solve class-weighted SVM in all its releases, and instance-weighted SVM in special versions of each release. I'm going to assume weka does not support the latter (which is what you need).</p>

<p>Class weighted SVM minimizes the following objective function:
$$
\min_{\mathbf{w},\xi} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2 + {\color{blue}C_{pos}} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{P}} \xi_i + {\color{blue}C_{neg}} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{N}} \xi_i,
$$
with $\mathbf{w}$ the separating hyperplane in feature space, $\xi$ the slack variables (which model training misclassification) and $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ the set of support vectors belonging to the positive and negative class, respectively. Using the weights $C_{pos}$ and $C_{neg}$ you can assign different misclassification penalties between classes.</p>

<p>Based on your question, it seems like you would ideally want to use 6 different weights (2 classes $\times$ 3 levels of certainty). You can achieve this for many approaches by duplicating samples of the points with high certainty. </p>

<p>For example, in terms of SVM, using the same data instance twice yields an identical solution to doubling its associated $C$ value. This is a very easy way to assign high misclassification penalties to certain data instances. You can follow the same approach for logistic regression.</p>

58707,23129.0,2,,16313.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Here's a quote from Andrew Gilpin (1993) advocating  Maurice Kendall's $τ$ over Spearman's $ρ$ for theoretical reasons: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Kendall's $τ$] approaches a normal distribution more rapidly than $ρ$, as $N$, the sample size, increases; and $τ$ is also more tractable mathematically, particularly when ties are present.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't add much about Goodman-Kruskal $γ$, other than that it seems to produce ever-so-slightly larger estimates than Kendall's $τ$ in a sample of survey data I've been working with lately... and of course, noticeably lower estimates than Spearman's $ρ$.  However, I also tried calculating a couple partial $γ$ estimates (Foraita &amp; Sobotka, 2012), and those came out closer to the partial $ρ$ than the partial $τ$... It took a fair amount of processing time though, so I'll leave the simulation tests or mathematical comparisons to someone else... (who would know how to do them...)</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/3277/ttnphns"">ttnphns</a> implies, you can't conclude that your $ρ$ estimates are better than your $τ$ estimates by magnitude alone, because their scales differ (even though the limits don't).  Gilpin cites Kendall (1962) as describing the ratio of $ρ$ to $τ$ to be roughly 1.5 over most of the range of values.  They get closer gradually as their magnitudes increase, so as both approach 1 (or -1), the difference becomes infinitesimal.  Gilpin gives a nice big table of equivalent values of $ρ$, $r$, $r^2$, <em>d</em>, and $Z_r$ out to the third digit for $τ$ at every increment of .01 across its range, just like you'd expect to see inside the cover of an intro stats textbook.  He based those values on Kendall's specific formulas, which are as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
r &amp;= \sin\bigg(\tau\cdot\frac \pi 2 \bigg)  \\
\rho &amp;= \frac 6 \pi \bigg(\tau\cdot\arcsin \bigg(\frac{\sin(\tau\cdot\frac \pi 2)} 2 \bigg)\bigg)
\end{aligned}
$$
(I simplified this formula for $ρ$ from the form in which Gilpin wrote, which was in terms of Pearson's $r$.)</p>

<p>Maybe it would make sense <strong>to convert your $τ$ into a $ρ$</strong> and see how the computational change affects your effect size estimate.  Seems that comparison would give some indication of the extent to which the problems that Spearman's $ρ$ is more sensitive to are present in your data, if at all.  More direct methods surely exist for identifying each specific problem individually; my suggestion would produce more of a quick-and-dirty omnibus effect size for those problems.  If there's no difference (after correcting for the difference in scale), then one might argue there's no need to look further for problems that only apply to $ρ$.  If there's a substantial difference, then it's probably time to break out the magnifying lens to determine what's responsible.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how people usually report effect sizes when using Kendall's $τ$ (to the unfortunately limited extent that people worry about reporting effect sizes in general), but since it seems likely that unfamiliar readers would try to interpret it on the scale of Pearson's $r$, it <strong>might be wise to report both</strong> your $τ$ statistic and its effect size on the scale of $r$ using the above conversion formula...or at least point out the difference in scale and give a shout out to Gilpin for his handy conversion table.</p>

58723,20473.0,1,,,,For which distributions does uncorrelatedness imply independence?,<probability><distributions><correlation><mathematical-statistics><independence>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>A time-honored reminder in statistics is ""uncorrelatedness does <em>not</em> imply independence"". Usually this reminder is supplemented with the psychologically soothing (and scientifically correct) statement ""when, nevertheless the two variables are <strong>jointly normally distributed</strong>, then uncorrelatedness does imply independence"".  </p>

<p>I can increase the count of happy exceptions from one to two: when two variables are <strong>Bernoulli-distributed</strong> , then again, uncorrelatedness implies independence. If $X$ and $Y$ are two Bermoulli rv's, $X \sim B(q_x),\; Y \sim B(q_y)$, for which we have $P(X=1) = E(X) = q_x$, and analogously for $Y$, their covariance is </p>

<p>$$\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)= E(XY) - E(X)E(Y) = \sum_{S_{XY}}p(x,y)xy - q_xq_y $$</p>

<p>$$ = P(X=1,Y=1) - q_xq_y = P(X=1\mid Y=1)P(Y=1)-q_xq_y$$</p>

<p>$$= \Big(P(X=1\mid Y=1)-q_x\Big)q_y $$</p>

<p>For uncorrelatedness we require the covariance to be zero so</p>

<p>$$\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0 \Rightarrow P(X=1\mid Y=1) = P(X=1)$$</p>

<p>$$\Rightarrow P(X=1,Y=1) = P(X=1)P(Y=1) $$</p>

<p>which is the condition that is also needed for the variables to be independent.  </p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>Do you know of any other distributions (continuous or discrete) for which uncorrelatedness implies independence?</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Assume two random variables $X,Y$ which have <em>marginal</em> distributions that belong to the same distribution (perhaps with different values for the distribution parameters involved), but let's say with the same support eg. two exponentials, two triangulars, etc. Does all solutions to the equation $\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0$ are such that they also imply independence, by virtue of the form/properties of the distribution functions involved? This is the case with the Normal marginals (given also that they have a bivariate normal distribution), as well as with the Bernoulli marginals -are there any other cases?</p>

<p>The motivation here is that it is usually easier to check whether covariance is zero, compared to check whether independence holds. So if, given the theoretical distribution, by checking covariance you are also checking independence (as is the case with the Bernoulli or normal case), then this would be a useful thing to know.<br>
If we are given two samples from two r.v's that have normal marginals, we know that if we can statistically conclude from the samples that their covariance is zero, we can also say that they are independent (but only because they have normal marginals). It would be useful to know whether we could conclude likewise in cases where the two rv's had marginals that belonged to some other distribution.</p>

58724,1145.0,2,,58179.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>This is a great question!</p>

<p>In my opinion the most important place to start an answer is to point out the distinction that should be drawn between P-values which are the result of a <em>significance test</em> and the decisions that are the results of <em>hypothesis tests</em>. Hypothesis tests are designed to control long term errors and are entirely frequentist in that the Frequentist or Repeated Sampling Principle is respected above all other considerations. In contrast the P-value from a significance test is an index of the evidence in the data and should be used for inference that is consistent with the Likelihood Principle.</p>

<p>Hypothesis tests and significance tests are usually assumed to be the same thing. Among the scientists with whom I hang out the most common test employed is a hybrid of the two which offers most of the disadvantages of both with few advantages. That hybrid has been written about many, including myself. See this paper for a description of the issues aimed at biomedical scientists: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22394284"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22394284</a>.</p>

<p>The various scenarios with ad hoc alterations to experimental design that you present are very problematical to a frequentist analyst because the long run error rates associated with decisions depend on <em>pre-specified</em> criteria of $\alpha$ (usually 0.05), sample size etc. If the experiment changes between the design phase and implementation it is difficult to know what characteristics of design to impute. Thus the alterations in design affect the error rates and it is not always easy to make an appropriate adjustment to the analysis that would be acceptable to everyone. </p>

<p>For example, if an experiment is extended beyond the initial design sample size then it begs the question of whether the extension is an attempt to gain 'significance' from data that didn't quite make it at the designed end point. Such behaviour increases the risk of false positive results. So does stopping prematurely with a significant result.</p>

<p>If you view the data as evidence then the matching up of experimental design and implementation is much less important. A larger sample will provide more reliable and more convincing evidence. The P-value need not be 'adjusted' or 'corrected' for deviations from the planned sample size when it is viewed as an index of evidence. </p>

<p>Of course, what it means to be an index of evidence is not clear to most people. It turns out that for any P-value from a significance test of a certain sample size (pre-specified or not) there is a specific likelihood function. That likelihood function depicts the evidence that the P-value indexes. I have written a long paper on this topic that, by happy coincidence, I arXived just two days ago. Its title is ""To P or not to P: on the evidential nature of P-values and their place in scientific inference"" <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0081"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0081</a>. The next paragraph is a relevant extract:</p>

<hr>

<p>The long-run error rates associated with an experiment are a property of the experimental design and the behaviour of the experimenter rather than of the data. The 'size' of the experiment, $\alpha$, is properly set before the data is available, so it cannot be data-dependent. In contrast, the P-value from a significance test is determined by the data rather than the arbitrary setting of a threshold. It cannot logically be an error rate because it doesn't force a decision in the way that inductive behaviour does, and if a decision is made to discard the null hypothesis when a small (presumably) P-value is observed, the decision is made on the basis of the smallness of the P-value in conjunction with whatever information that the experimenter considers relevant. Thus the rate of erroneous inferences is a function of not only the P-value but the quality and availability of additional information and, sometimes, the intuition of the experimenter. P-values are not error rates, whether 'observed', 'obtained' or 'implied'.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, answers. Yes, P-values are still useful in your scenarios. Unadjusted P-values still index the likelihood functions that depict the evidence in the data and you can still make inferences using that evidence. You should not adjust the P-values for multiple comparisons, but instead understand that the evidence needs to be interpreted in light of the number of comparisons made. Deviations from the plan will invalidate frequentist hypothesis tests, but not necessarily invalidate a likelihood-based evaluation of the evidence.</p>

<p>Getting the most out of the evidence and avoiding inflated type I errors are not the same thing, and you cannot comply with the frequentist principle and the likelihood principle at the same time in many circumstances. Your edit makes it sound like you have a Bayesian model in mind. That is usually a good idea (and will usually comply with the likelihood principle).</p>

<p>Not entirely. Cross-validation is indeed used to get an estimate of the generalization performance of a model, but when performing cross-validation the entire training set is never used to construct a single model.

<p>Let us consider a simplistic hierarchical model of response, where there is an individual-level characteristic $\theta_i$ which has some distribution $f(\theta)$ and a test-specific response $y_{ij}$ for tests $j \in {1,2}$ that depends upon the individual-level characteristic through its distribution $p_j(y_{ij} | \theta_i)$.  If we know $i$ for each $y_{ij}$ we can obviously do the paired test, and the difference between $y_{i1}$ and $y_{i2}$ obviously are not influenced by the differences between the $\theta_i$, since it is for the same $i$.  </p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we don't know the individual $i$, we are faced with draws from two distributions $p^*_j(y_{ij}) = \int_\Theta p_j(y_{ij} | \theta_i) f(\theta_i)\text{d}\theta_i$.  The scores $y_{ij}$ are still independent across $i$ and, under the null, independent across $j$ as well.  The distribution itself no longer varies across $i$.  Under alternative hypotheses, the distributions $p_j$ will still differ across $j$, it's just that they are population-level distributions rather than individual-level distributions.  </p>

<p>Consequently, we can still perform an (unpaired) test for differences between $j$, but it's going to be less powerful than if you could get rid of the extra variability introduced by not knowing the individuals.  It's just a matter of what you can condition on; more conditioning reduces variability and thereby increases power.  </p>

<p>Personally, I'd use the unpaired version of the Wilcoxon, as you can't lose much relative to the unpaired version of the $t$-test and you might gain a lot.  See <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/19681/when-to-use-the-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test-instead-of-the-unpaired-t-test/19682#19682"">this question</a> for a little more information.</p>

<p>Of greater concern is that missing 10% of the original sample.  You'd really like to understand the missing data mechanism, if any.   Consider the possibility that the 10 who dropped out were among the poorest performers on the original test, and that the amount of improvement was strongly negatively related to how well an individual performed on the first test (i.e., poor performers improved a lot more on average than good performers).  That, combined with regression-to-the-mean effects, means you'd likely be missing data on some of your largest gains, thus a) weakening your ability to detect a significant difference, and b) biasing your estimate(s) of how much improvement there was downwards.  OTOH, under the null hypotheses, we expect to see a gain, because we are including the low scorers in sample 1 but removing 10 likely low scorers from sample 2.  So there's an upwards bias there too.  Which effect dominates isn't clear, but what is clear is that your test and associated estimates would almost certainly be biased.</p>

<p>For example, if I simulate from the simple model above assuming $\theta_i \sim \text{N}(0,1)$ and $y_{ij} \sim \text{N}(\theta_i,1)$, and drop the $y_{i2}$ for which $y_{i1}$ was in the 10 lowest values, the expected value of $y_{i2} \approx 0.136$ while that of $y_{i1} = 0$.  0.136 is about 0.96 standard deviations above 0, relative to the std. dev. of the difference between the means of $y_{i1}$ and $y_{i2}$, which would obviously have a huge impact on your type I and type II error probabilities.</p>

seas1 &lt;- fourier(x, K=3)
seas2 &lt;- fourier(ts(x, freq=48*5), K=3)
fit &lt;- auto.arima(x, xreg=cbind(seas1,seas2))

seas1.f &lt;- fourierf(x, K=3, h=48*5)
seas2.f &lt;- fourierf(ts(x, freq=48*5), K=3, h=48*5)
fc &lt;- forecast(fit, xreg=cbind(seas1.f,seas2.f))

<p>Let <span class=""math-container"">$(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$</span> denote the underlying probability space. For the problem to make sense, consider the random variables with finite second moments, that is, the Hilbert space <span class=""math-container"">$L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$</span>.

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Re <em>""...,by construction.""</em></p>

<p>By definition, the conditional mean of <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> on <span class=""math-container"">$X$</span> is a random variable <span class=""math-container"">$\psi$</span>

</ol>

<p>Standard Hilbert space projection arguments show that such a <span class=""math-container"">$\psi$</span> always exists and is unique.</p>

<p>This applies to any Hilbert space. The above can be re-phrased verbatim for, say, <span class=""math-container"">$\mathbb{R}^n$</span>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let <span class=""math-container"">$Y \in \mathbb{R}^n$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$V$</span> be a subspace. Then the projection of
  <span class=""math-container"">$Y$</span> onto <span class=""math-container"">$V$</span> is characterized by the same two properties:</p>

For a few services we have fairly good replication (i.e. ~15 quotes), for some of the services we have some degree of replication (i.e. 5-10 quotes per service). But for about a third of the services replication is very poor, i.e. &lt;5 quotes per service.</p>

<p>The data have proven extremely challenging and time consuming to collect and I doubt if there will be more.</p>

<p>The upside to this story is that there are several construction cost estimation tools that can give us estimates of the costs of these services.

<p>The coefficient of variation is almost identical in the two samples, which does suggest that you might consider these as having a scale shift; if you think the logs look reasonably close to normal, then that would suggest lognormal distributions with common coefficient of variation.

<p>For example, Watson-Nadaraya kernel regression estimates a function $f : \mathcal X \to \mathbb R$ based on observations $\{ (x_i, y_i) \}_{i=1}^n$ by

Rather, the important practical problem for kernel smoothing methods is that of <em>bandwidth selection</em>: choosing the scale of the kernel function. Undersmoothing or oversmoothing can result in extremely poor estimates, and so care must be taken to choose an appropriate bandwidth, often via cross-validation.</p>

<p>where $D_{ij} = sign(X_i - X_j)$</p>

<p>Then Pettitt follows expressing a test for discrete Bernoulli and Binomial data and two variants for continuos data.</p>

<p>For discrete test, he use $U_{t,T} = T \cdot (S_t - \frac{tS_t}{T})$, where $S_t = \sum_{1}^{T} X_j$, $S_T = \sum_{1}^{T} X_j$ and $X_j$ is eval function expresed like Bernoulli serie where values are 0 or 1.</p>

<p>For continuos test, he use:</p>

<ol>
<li>$U_{t,T} = 2 \cdot W_t - t(T+1)$, when $W_t=\sum R_j$ and $R_j$ are the rank or the data. (There is a variation when ties exists.)</li>
<li>$U_{t,T} = U_{t-1,T} + V_{t,T}$, with $t=2,\dots,T$ and $V_{t,T} = \sum_{j=1}^{T} sign(X_t - X_j)$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, my original code are variant 1 for continuos test and results are correct, except for guessing critical values in Pettitt series results. </p>

<p>I calculate these critical values solving $K_T$ from

58782,22507.0,2,,55361.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I am not going to analyze the code, but below is the solution.</p>

<p>Let</p>

<ul>
<li>P(loc60) be the probability that a random locomotive has number 60</li>
<li>P(N) be the prior probability that there are exactly N locomotives</li>
<li>P(loc60|N) be the probability that a random locomotive has number 60, if the total number of locomotives is N,</li>
<li>P(N|loc60) be the probability that there are exactly N locomotives, if a random locomotive has number 60</li>
</ul>

<p>Then</p>

<p>$$ P(N|\text{loc60}) = {P(\text{loc60}|N) P(N) \over P(\text{loc60})} = {P(\text{loc60}|N) P(N) \over \sum_M P(\text{loc60}|M)}$$</p>

<p>But $$ P(\text{loc60}|N) = \cases {1/N &amp; if $N\ge 60$ \\ 0 &amp; otherwise } $$</p>

<p>From now on, we assume that $N \ge 60$.</p>

<p>$$ P(N|\text{loc60}) = {P(N)/N \over \sum_{M=60}^\infty P(M)/M} $$</p>

<p>Now we should select P(N), otherwise we are stuck.  Since we don't know even the order of magnitude of P(N), it is reasonable to assume that $\log N$ is uniformly distributed between 0 and some $\log N_\max$ (i. e. the probability that $10^2\le N&lt;10^3$ is the same as the probability that $10^3\le N&lt;10^4$).  Guestimating $N_\max$ is a tricky task, but from my prior knowledge about railroads and locomotives, I can assume that $N_\max \gg 60$  .</p>

<p>The uniform distribution of $\log N$ means that $$P(N) = c(\log (N+1)-\log N) \approx c/N$$, where c is a constant independent on N.</p>

<p>Substituting this to the previous formula, we have:
$$ P(N|\text{loc60}) \approx {c/N^2 \over \sum_{M=60}^{N_\max} c/M^2} $$</p>

<p>But $$\sum_{M=60}^{N_\max} c/M^2 \approx \int_{60}^{N_\max} {c\over M^2}dM = {c \over 60} - {c \over N_\max} \approx {c\over60} $$</p>

<p>Now we have</p>

<p>$$ P(N|\text{loc60}) \approx {60/N^2} $$</p>

<p>What is the median value of N?  Let it be $N_\text{med}$ , then</p>

<p>$$ \int_{60}^{N_\text{med}} {60 \over N^2} dN = 1/2 $$</p>

<p>$$ 60/N - {60 \over N_\text{med}} = 1/2 $$</p>

<p>$$ N_\text{med} = 120 $$</p>

<p>If what we need is mathematical expectation rather than median, then</p>

<p>$$ E(N) = \int_{60}^{N_\max} {60\over N^2} N dN = 60 \log {N_\max \over 60} $$</p>

<p>From what I know about railroads, $N_\max$ should be between $10^3$ and $10^6$, so E(N) is somewhere between 170 and 600.</p>

58785,15972.0,2,,58720.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>The law of total variance is the easiest way to do this. But there are several occasions when we don't know how many random variables we are dealing with (e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_process"" rel=""noreferrer"">branching processes</a> such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton%E2%80%93Watson_process"" rel=""noreferrer"">Galton-Watson</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth%E2%80%93death_process"" rel=""noreferrer"">birth-death processes</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory"" rel=""noreferrer"">queues</a>) where <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability-generating_function"" rel=""noreferrer"">probability-generating functions</a> are a useful technique. It is possible to derive mean and variance using the PGF, so I want to demonstrate how this can serve as an alternative. Why bother? One motivation is that this method will generalize easily to find any <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_moment"" rel=""noreferrer"">factorial moment</a>, and hence any moment, of distribution.</p>

<p>A few general results: a PGF $G_X(z)=\mathbb{E}(z^X)$ has $\lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G_X(z)=\lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, \mathbb{E}(z^X)=1$. Factorial moments are found by taking the limit of the appropriate derivative of the PGF as $z$ goes to 1 from below. So for a random variable $X$:</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{E}(X) &amp;=&amp; \lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G'_X(z)\\
\mathbb{E}(X(X-1)) &amp;=&amp; \lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G''_X(z)\\
\mathbb{E}(X(X-1)(X-2)) &amp;=&amp; \lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G'''_X(z) 
\end{eqnarray}</p>

<p>And so on for higher moments. The key here is that if $S_N=\sum_{i=1}^N X_i$ with iid $X_i$ then $G_{S_N}(z)=G_N(G_X(z))$. Proof:</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray}
G_{S_N}(z) &amp;=&amp; \mathbb{E}_N(\mathbb{E}(z^{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i})) &amp;=&amp; \mathbb{E}_N(\mathbb{E}(\prod_{i=1}^N z^{X_i})) &amp;=&amp; \mathbb{E}_N(\prod_{i=1}^N (\mathbb{E}(z^{X_i})) \\
  &amp;=&amp; \mathbb{E}_N(\prod_{i=1}^N G_X(z)) &amp;=&amp; \mathbb{E}_N(G_X(z)^N) &amp;=&amp; G_N(G_X(z))
\end{eqnarray}</p>

<p>Also note $\lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G_X(z)=\lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G_N(z)=1$, $\lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G'_X(z)=\mu_X$, $\lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G'_N(z)=\mu_N$, $\lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G''_X(z)=\mathbb{E}(X^2-X)=\sigma_X^2+\mu_X^2-\mu_X$ and $\lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G''_N(z)=\sigma_N^2+\mu_N^2-\mu_N$.</p>

<p>Since $G_{S_N}(z)=G_N(G_X(z))$ we can use the chain rule to find the mean and variance of $S_N$:</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{E}(S_N) &amp;=&amp; \lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, \frac{d}{dz}G_N(G_X(z))=\lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, G'_X(z)G'_N(G_X(z))=\mu_X \mu_N\\
\mathbb{E}(S_N(S_N-1)) &amp;=&amp; \lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, \frac{d^2}{dz^2}G_N(G_X(z))\\
\mathbb{E}(S_N^2-S_N) &amp;=&amp; \lim_{z\uparrow 1}\, \left(G''_X(z)G'_N(G_X(z))+G'_X(z)^2 G''_N(G_X(z))\right) \\
\mathbb{E}(S_N^2)-\mu_X \mu_N &amp;=&amp; (\sigma_X^2+\mu_X^2-\mu_X)(\mu_N)+(\mu_X)^2(\sigma_N^2+\mu_N^2-\mu_N) \\
\mathbb{E}(S_N^2) &amp;=&amp; \mu_N \sigma_X^2 + \mu_X^2 \sigma_N^2 + \mu_X^2 \mu_N^2 \\
\operatorname{Var}(S_N) &amp;=&amp; \mathbb{E}(S_N^2)-\mathbb{E}(S_N)^2=\mu_N \sigma_X^2 + \mu_X^2 \sigma_N^2 + \mu_X^2 \mu_N^2-(\mu_X \mu_N)^2 \\
\operatorname{Var}(S_N) &amp;=&amp; \mu_N \sigma_X^2 + \mu_X^2 \sigma_N^2
\end{eqnarray}</p>

<p>It's a little gruesome and there's no doubt the law of total variance is easier. But if the standard results are taken for granted, this is only a couple of lines of algebra and calculus, and I've given more detail than some of the other answers which makes it look worse than it is.

<p>Looking at the plot:</p>

<p>Edit: Since whuber has given a comprehensive answer (one which I happily upvoted), so I won't go through the details of how to do it in this cut down case, but you could apply similar techniques to the search over a smaller space.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Working by hand</em></p>

<p>In the past when I've done it, I often do a hand search first, because it often turns out that by starting with a reasonable choice and tweaking it (swapping a few points in and out to improve the characteristics I want) I can often get something quite good enough in a few tries, saving the effort of coding a more formal search.</p>

<p>So for example, just by eye, I'd start with (say) these six points:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rF0iv.png"" alt=""hand selected points""></p>

<p>And then by looking at the direction of deviations of the values of the sample statistics I want (like the correlation) from the values I want them to have, and the likely effect of swapping a point in the set with a point not in, I can usually get close enough for my purposes in a minute or two. </p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, a spreadsheet like Excel is often a good tool for this task. I mark what's in (/not in) the sample with say a column of 1's and 0's and compute the statistics I want from that. A few moments of choosing which points to put in or out (swapping the 1s and 0s) and its done.</p>

<p>Such approaches are also useful when making up data - simulate something close to what's desired, and then manipulate a few points (adding or removing or altering) to make it look closer to what you need. Again, a spreadsheet is often a handy tool for this type of task.</p>

$$
\frac{1}{2}\|w\|^2+C\sum_i\max(0,1-y_i(w^\intercal x_i+b))

$$
\frac{1}{2}\|w\|^2

My model is similar to a typical regression, with several parameters (~10) with priors modelled by uniform distributions, and a single observation modelled by a normal distribution with a deterministic mean and uniform standard deviation (through a precision deterministic). The mean (dynamic) response of the system is actually generated by an ordinary differential equation and typically yields around 1500 data points. I can get reasonably accurate results using either Adaptive or Non-Adaptive MCMC, with around 50K samples following 50K burn-in samples.</p>

<p>Based on issues reported with BF for complex models, I started looking at the DIC values produced after performing the MCMC analysis, but for models consisting of various combinations of the true parameter set, they were quite large with very little difference between them. For example, -14623.9 and -14624.8. Are the DIC, and other similar criterion such as BPIC, normally so insensitive to different (sub-)models?</p>

<p>Given $\gamma_j$, its corresponding eigenvalue is $\lambda_j= \frac{1}{1-\gamma_j^2}-1$.</p>

<p>Wilk's lambda statistic for it is $w_j= \frac{1}{1+\lambda_j}w_{j+1}$. So, first compute $w_m$ which is $\frac{1}{1+\lambda_m}$, then compute $w_{m-1}$ using $w_m$, etc., backwards.</p>

<p>This statistic has approximately Chi-square distribution (under assumptions of normality and large $N$) with $df_j= (p_x-j+1)(p_y-j+1)$. To recalculate Wilk's into the Chi-square: $\chi_j^2= -\ln(w_j)(N-(p_x+p_y+3)/2)$.</p>

<p>So, substitute $\chi_j^2$ in Chi-square cdf distribution with $df_j$, subtract from 1, and have the p-value for correlation $\gamma_j$.</p>

<p>What does this p-value mean in fact? Nonsignificant p-value for $\gamma_1$ tells that all canonical correlations $\gamma_1$ through $\gamma_m$ are not significant (i.e. the hypothesis that they all are zero should not be rejected). Significant p-value for $\gamma_1$ and nonsignificant p-value for $\gamma_2$ tells that $\gamma_1$ is significant (likely to be nonzero in the population), while the rest $\gamma_2$ through $\gamma_m$ are all not significant; etc. Sometimes, p-value for $\gamma_{j+1}$ is lower than for $\gamma_{j}$. That should not be taken in the sense ""$\gamma_{j+1}$ is more significant"" because a more junior correlation cannot be more significant than more senior one. As said already, if $\gamma_{j}$ is not significant for you, all the remaining junior correlations must automatically be considered not significant too.</p>

What would be a reasonable test statistic / calculation of the p-value to accept or reject the hypothesis?</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>

<p>The matches I sample are independent of a specific team. I just take a number of matches and count for the home teams - wins, ties and defeats. Due to symmetry the guest teams will have deterministically corresponding results and hence can be ignored.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The generalized POV</strong>:</p>

<p>$A_1$ be the random variable for the number of matches the local team won in a total sample of $N$ matches. Naturally this is a bernoulli experiment (given we only assume the possibility of win and lose) and the <strong>p-value</strong> of the hypothesis ""a home court advantage exists - i.e. the probability of a home win $p_1$ is larger than 0.5."" given $a_1$ observed wins is:</p>

<p>$$\Pr[A_1 &gt;= a_1 | p_1 = 0.5]=\sum_{k={a_1}}^N{N\choose{k}}(0.5)^k$$</p>

<p>So far so good (though please correct me if I am wrong or my wording is problematic) - now the aspect that puzzles me is how to factor in ties.</p>

<p>My idea would be to create a test statistic $\tilde{A}_1 := A_1 + \lfloor{A_0/2}\rfloor$ with $A_1$ and $A_0$ being the random variables for number of home wins and ties in $N$ matches.</p>

<p>$$\Pr[\tilde{A}_1 &gt;= \tilde{a}_1 | \tilde{p}_1 = 0.5]=\sum_{k={a_1}}^N{N\choose{k}}(0.5)^k$$</p>

<p>Now in my mind this makes sense somehow because it reflects the indecisive and symmetric nature of a tie.</p>

<p>On the other hand I am not sure how to bend the bernoulli experiment to reflect the notion of $\tilde{p}_1$ being the probability of a home win in the second model (which means home win or ""50% of a tie"") while keeping up the pretence of formal correctness.</p>

$$y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \varepsilon_i$$

<p>Suppose I have two instruments measuring a common entity, say, density of samples of different liquids, and assume that we do not know the exact density of each liquid (nor is there any way to accurately measure it).</p>

<p>My objective is to construct a model that will summarise the difference between the two instruments.</p>

<p>Here is how I go about it: (for simplicity sake, all models are SLR models)</p>

<p>Let readings from instrument 1 and instrument 2 when measuring the $i$-th liquid be $y_i$ and $w_i$ respectively, and the actual density of the $i$-th liquid be $x_i$ Then we have:
$$y_i=\alpha_1+\beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_{1i} \\
w_i=\alpha_2+\beta_2 x_i + \varepsilon_{2i}$$
where $\varepsilon_{1i}$ and $\varepsilon_{2i}$ are i.i.d and equal variance w.r.t $i$.</p>

<p>Rearranging from the second equation we have:
$$x_i= \frac{w_i- \alpha_2- \varepsilon_{2i}}{\beta_2 } $$
Plugging into the first equation,
$$ \begin{align*} y_i &amp;=\alpha_1+\beta_1 \frac{w_i- \alpha_2- \varepsilon_{2i}}{\beta_2 } + \varepsilon_{1i} \\ 
&amp;= \alpha_1 - \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2} \alpha_2 + \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2} w_i + \varepsilon_{1i}-\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\varepsilon_{2i}\\
&amp;= \alpha + \beta w_i + \varepsilon_i
\end{align*}
$$</p>

<p>where $\beta = \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}$, $\alpha = \alpha_1 - \beta \alpha_2$,  and $ \varepsilon_i = \varepsilon_{1i}-\beta \varepsilon_{2i}$, and $ \varepsilon_i $ are consequently i.i.d. with equal variance w.r.t. $i$.</p>

<p>I would like to ask,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this a valid SLR model for my objective? Do I just treat readings from instrument 2 as an 'independent variable' and proceed like a normal SLR analysis?</p></li>
<li><p>If so, can I interpret the slope($\beta$) as the ratio of the individual slopes of the two instruments?</p></li>
<li><p>Can I then test the hypothesis that the two instruments are similar by testing $\alpha = 0$ and $ \beta =1 $?</p></li>

<p>Both methods minimize the residual sum of squares and have a constraint on the possible values of the parameters $\beta$. For the Lasso, the constraint is $||\beta||_1 \le t$, whereas for ridge it is $||\beta||_2 \le t$, for some $t$.</p>

<p>I've seen the diamond vs ellipse picture in the book and I have some intuition as for why the Lasso can hit the corners of the constrained region, which implies that one of the coefficients is set to zero. However, my intuition is rather weak, and I'm not convinced. It should be easy to see, but I don't know why this is true.</p>

<p>So I guess I'm looking for a mathematical justification, or an intuitive explanation of why the contours of the residual sum of squares are likely to hit the corners of the  $||\beta||_1$ constrained region (whereas this situation is unlikely if the constraint is $||\beta||_2$).</p>

An example of this notation is the following:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$ y_i \sim \text{Binomial}(p_i,n_i) \\
 \log\left(\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right) = b_i  \\
b_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_p,\sigma_p) $$</span></p>
<p>which would describe a hierarchical logistic model with no predictors, but with <span class=""math-container"">$i = 1\dots n $</span> groups. This way of describing models seem to work equally well for describing frequentist and Bayesian models, for example, to make this model description fully Bayesian you would just have to add priors on <span class=""math-container"">$\mu_p$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\sigma_p$</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Is this type of model notation/formalism described in detail in some article or book?</strong></p>
<p>If you want to use this notation to write models there are many different ways of doing things and it would be really useful with a comprehensive guide both to follow and to reference others to. Some differences I've found in how people use this type of notation:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you call distributions? E.g., I've seen <span class=""math-container"">$\mathcal{N},\text{N},\text{Norm},\text{Normal}$</span>, etc.</li>
<li>How do you deal with indexes? E.g. I've seen <span class=""math-container"">$y_{ij}$</span>,<span class=""math-container"">$y_{i[j]}$</span>,<span class=""math-container"">$y_{j|i}$</span>, etc.</li>
<li>Which parameter symbols are usually used for parameters. For example, it is common to use <span class=""math-container"">$\mu$</span> as the mean for the normal distribution, but what about other distributions? (For this I usually check the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">distributions of Wikipedia</a>)</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>fit5 &lt;- glm(Carrier~1, family=""binomial"")  
1-pchisq(deviance(fit5)-deviance(fit4), df.residual(fit5)-df.residual(fit4))  
## [1] 0.0009765625
</code></pre>

<p>So the p-value indicates that at least one of <code>logCK</code> and <code>H</code> is useful. Then I'm stuck at the next question, it asks me to calculate odds ratio for a woman with (CK, H)=(300,100) over one with (CK, H)=(80, 85).  </p>

<p>But how can I get a meaningful result with all coefficients in this model ranging so wildly? Is there anything wrong with the way I did this logistic regression? Are there any remedial measures?  </p>

58829,17573.0,2,,58807.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Picking up on the comment of @user31264, CPI is calculated with a formula like this:
\begin{align}
CPI_t = \frac{\sum_i w_i p_{it}}{\sum_i w_i p_{it^*}}
\end{align}
Price of item $i$ at time $t$ is $p_{it}$.  Prices in the baseline year are $p_{it^*}$.  Each price's weight in the CPI is $w_i$.  These weights are determined from a ""market basket"" which represents an attempt to match the spending habits of a typical US, urban household (assuming you are talking about the CPI-U for the US) --- you can productively think of these weights as representing the quantity of item $i$ bought by an average US household.  The weights are not literally these quantities, but it is OK to think about them this way most of the time.</p>

<p>Some of the items (some of the $i$) are food items, and some are not.  Let's denote the food items as $i \in F$ and the non-food items as $i \not\in F$.  Then CPI-food and CPI ex food look like:
\begin{align}
CPI_t^F &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i \in F} w_i p_{it}}{\sum_{i \in F} w_i p_{it^*}}\\
 &amp;\strut \\
CPI_t^{\tilde{}F} &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i \not\in F} w_i p_{it}}{\sum_{i \not\in F} w_i p_{it^*}}\\
\end{align}</p>

<p>Now, we can do some algebra:
\begin{align}
CPI_t &amp;= \frac{\sum_i w_i p_{it}}{\sum_i w_i p_{it^*}}\\ \strut \\
      &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i \in F} w_i p_{it}+\sum_{i \not\in F} w_i p_{it}} 
              {\sum_iw_ip_{it^*}} \\ \strut\\
      &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i \in F} w_i p_{it^*}}{\sum_iw_ip_{it^*}}
         \frac{\sum_{i \in F} w_i p_{it}}{\sum_{i \in F} w_i p_{it^*}}
        +\frac{\sum_{i \not\in F} w_i p_{it^*}}{\sum_iw_ip_{it^*}}
         \frac{\sum_{i \not\in F} w_i p_{it}}{\sum_{i \not\in F} w_i p_{it^*}}
         \\ \strut\\
      &amp;=\frac{\sum_{i \in F} w_i p_{it^*}}{\sum_iw_ip_{it^*}} \cdot CPI_t^F 
        +\frac{\sum_{i \not\in F}w_i p_{it^*}}{\sum_iw_ip_{it^*}}\cdot CPI_t^{\tilde{}F} 
        \\ \strut \\
CPI_t^{\tilde{}F} &amp;= \frac{\sum_iw_ip_{it^*}}{\sum_{i \not\in F}w_i p_{it^*}} 
                     \cdot CPI_t
                    -\frac{\sum_{i \in F} w_i p_{it^*}}{\sum_{i \not\in F}w_i p_{it^*}}
                     \cdot CPI_t^F
\end{align}</p>

<p>So, to back out CPI ex food from CPI and CPI food, you divide overall CPI by the proportion of spending on non-food in the baseline year (the year the market basket was measured in), then you subtract off the CPI food times the ratio of food to non-food spending in the baseline/market-basket year.</p>

<p>You need to be careful that each of the years of CPI data you use are calculated based on the same market basket.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics does occasionally update the market basket.  Currently, <a href=""http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_6"" rel=""nofollow"">CPI is based on a 2009/10 market basket.</a>  Furthermore, if you use a ""chained"" index, the market basket is updated every year, so that the method outlined here does not apply.</p>

<p>Finally, a caveat.  What the BLS actually does to calculate the CPI is more complicated than what I have laid out above.  What I have laid out above is the basic idea, but the implementation details are dizzying.  Spend a long time reading the various reports and documentation on the <a href=""http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">BLS website</a> if you want to actually understand.</p>

Imagine I have training data of $M=7,000,000$ samples. Each training sample contains a variable number of words in the body, and a variable amount of tags assigned to the case. There are roughly 100 million unique words, and roughly 40,000 unique tags.</p>

<p>The goal is to, given a set of words, to correctly classify the tag(s) when the tags are not observed.</p>

<p>Intuition tells me to simply compute the probability for each word, and then use the conditional probability for each tag given the set of words for a tag. More concretely:</p>

<p>Imagine one case has 5 unique words. Each word will have a $P(W_i)$. This is a constant value for the training set, and can be stored in memory. The probability of $T_1$ given $P(W_1, W_2....W_5)$, is then simply the number of occurrences in the intersection of $T_1$ for each word divided by $M$.</p>

<p>Why does Naive Bayes suggest using (according to the Bayes rule) $\frac{P(W_1..W_5|T_1) * P(T_1)}{P(W_1...W_5)}$  when $P(T_1|W_1...W_5)$ seems easier to obtain, and more intuitive*?</p>

<p>Let me start with your last equation:
\begin{align}
y_i = \alpha + \beta w_i + \epsilon_i
\end{align}</p>

<p>Now, let's assume that your earlier equations for $y$ and $w$ are valid classical linear regression models, so that $Cov(x,\epsilon_1)=0$ and $Cov(x,\epsilon_2)=0$.  I'm not sure what SLR stands for---Simple Linear Regression?</p>

<p>Anyway, now let's calculate $Cov(w,\epsilon)$ in order to verify whether your new equation is part of a valid classical linear regression model (recall that we need this to be zero):
\begin{align}
Cov(w,\epsilon) &amp;= Cov(w,\epsilon_1-\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\epsilon_2) \\ \strut \\
                &amp;= Cov(w,\epsilon_1) - \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}Cov(w,\epsilon_2)

                &amp;= Cov(\epsilon_2,\epsilon_1) - \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}V(\epsilon_2)
\end{align}</p>

<p>The second term is not zero unless $\beta_1=0$, and that would make the example pretty silly.  Even the first term is not likely to be zero in most physical applications.  For that term to be zero, you would have to make the additional assumption that the errors made by the two instruments were completely uncorrelated.  You could get wildly lucky (in a stopped-clock-is-right-twice-a-day kind of sense) and the two terms could magically cancel out, but there is no systematic tendency of the two terms to cancel out.</p>

<p>The bias in estimating $\beta$ will be:
\begin{align}
\frac{Cov(\epsilon_2,\epsilon_1) - \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}V(\epsilon_2)}{V(w)}
\end{align}</p>

<p>Below, I attach a bit of <code>R</code> code which makes a toy monte carlo to demonstrate the effect.  The theoretical bias in the monte carlo is -0.25 and the answer we get in the monte carlo is too low by 0.23.  So, demonstrates the point pretty well.</p>

<p>In general, even if you can't see how to evaluate the bias in an example like this, you can always run a little monte carlo to see what is going on.  This is one of the great things about statistical software languages.  Monte Carlo simulations are amazingly powerful tools to give you feedback as to whether your ideas are really good or really not.</p>

The steps I perform are: deseasonalizing the data, finding the linear regression for the deseasonalized points, predicting a few points from the linear regression and adding seasonality to the predicted values to get forecast data. My input is quite sinusoidal so all works well.  </p>

<p>The problem is that the more in the future you predict, the more prediction errors increase. I'd like to show that on a chart, but I am not sure how to calculate these errors. I was thinking something like prediction interval bands for forecast data (whatever they are called). These bands would increase the further you predict in the future.</p>

<p>a) One of the requirements in order to perform valid statistical tests of necessity is that the variance of the errors from the proposed model must not be proven to be non-constant. If the variance of the errors changes at discrete points in time then one has recourse to Generalized Least Squares or GLM . </p>

<p>b) If the variance of the errors is linearly relatable to the level of the observed series then a Logarithmic Transformation might be appropriate. If the square root of the variance of the errors is linearly relatable to the level of the original series then a Square Root transformation is appropriate. More generally the appropriate power transformation is found via the Box-Cox test where the optimal lambda is found. Note that the Box-Cox test is universally applicable and doesn't soley requite time series or spatail data.</p>

<p>All of the above ( a and b ) require that the mean of the errors cannot be proven to differ significantly from zero for all points. If your data is not time series or spatial in nature then the only anomaly you can detect is a pulse. However if your data is time series or spatial then Level Shifts , Seasonal Pulses and/or Local Time Trends might be suggested to render the mean value of the error term to be 0.0 everywhere or at least not significantly different from 0.0 .</p>

<p>In my opinion one should never willy-nilly transform the data unless one has to in order to satisfy (in part) the Gaussian assumptions. Some econometricians take logs for the simple and simply wrong reason in order to obtain direct estimates of elasticity's rather than assessing the % change in Y for a % change in x from the best model.</p>

<p>Now one caveat, if one knows from theory or at least one thinks that one knows from theory that transformations are necessary i.e. proven by previous well-documented research , then by all means follow that paradigm as it may prove to be more beneficial that the empirical procedures I have laid out here.</p>

<p>In closing use the original data, minimize any warping of the results by mindless transformations, test all assumptions and sleep well at night. Statisticians like Doctors should never do harm to their data/patients y providing drugs/transformations that have nasty and unwarranted side-effects.</p>

58857,594.0,2,,58796.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Here's the situation as I understand it:</p>

<p>1) you want to test for equality of spread with heavy tailed distributions. </p>

<p>2) you assume they will only differ in spread.</p>

<p>3) you have a measure of spread already in mind (median absolute deviation); what you need is a single statistic that identifies how much those spreads are unalike (since it's a measure of scale, their ratio is a reasonable choice, but in fact for what I am going to suggest we're going to be able to do something simpler).</p>

<p>4) the usual assumptions like independence etc apply.</p>

<p>(5) it sounds like you are using R; if I give any example code I'll use R also)</p>

<p>With these assumptions, under the null, the distributions of the two samples are the same; the null is a test of identical distributions, the test statistic is a measure that's sensitive to a particular kind of deviation from identical distributions.</p>

<p>If you want a test where dispersion is measured by median absolute deviation, then in these circumstances you could just do a permutation test (or randomization test if the samples are too large to evaluate all permutations).</p>

<p>Because it's a permutation test, we don't have to take the ratio of mads, anything whose size is sensitive to deviations from the null would also work. In this case I'm going to discuss looking at the mad of the smaller-sized sample, in the hopes of calculating a bit faster (though calculation speed shouldn't be the only consideration, it allows me to make some useful points about what we're doing along the way).</p>

<p>If the null were true, the labels for the two groups are 'arbitrary' - we could combine the samples and randomly relabel the observations without altering their underlying distribution. However, under the alternative, the labels signify something important - that we are sampling from distributions that differ in spread. In that case, the sample test statistic won't be 'typical' of the permutation distribution.</p>

<p>Basic outline of how to do a test of equality of distributions using a specified statistic</p>

<p>Permutation test:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Combine both samples and allocate the set of group labels in all possible combinations to find the distribution of the test statistic under the null of identical distributions, calculating the test statistic each time.</p></li>
<li><p>find how far 'in from the end(s)' the sample value occurs, and calculate the proportion of null values from the permutation distribution that are at least as extreme as it. (the p-value)</p></li>
<li><p>If the sample statistic is sufficiently extreme in the null distribution (if that p-value is low enough), reject the null.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In this case I assume you want a two-tailed test and then (with the mad of the smaller group as the statistic) we have the problem of what to count up to in the other tail (this would be easy with the ratio, since we just take the reciprocal). However we'll take the ratio to the combined mad (which doesn't change so we don't have to sample that), and use the reciprocal from that to get the cutoff in the other tail.</p>

<p>The randomization test is basically the same as the above but instead of evaluating all possible permutations it simply samples (with replacement) from the set of permutations.</p>

<p>[Another alternative would be to use bootstrapping; in that case you're seeing whether a ratio of median absolution deviations of 1 could plausibly have come from the bootstrap distribution of the ratio. In this case you would resample with replacement <em>within groups</em> and compute the ratio each time, and see whether the null value is consistent with it (would be inside a confidence interval for the ratio). But bootstrapping tends not to work so well on medians, and you would require fairly large samples. A smoother (but similarly robust) statistic might work better.]</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Example</strong> (here I've chosen the sample sizes to be just a little bit too large to do a permutation test; there's 3.2 billion combinations - you <em>could</em> do it if you were determined to get the exact permutation distribution, but we won't)</p>

<pre><code># create some data with heavy tail and different spread
set.seed(3498732)
nrand &lt;- 100000
x &lt;- rt(20,df=3)*5+50
y &lt;- rt(15,df=3)*20+50
print(x,d=4)
print(y,d=4)
xy &lt;- c(x,y)

# do the randomization
madrand &lt;- replicate(nrand,mad(sample(xy,15),constant=1))
mm &lt;- mad(xy,constant=1)
t &lt;- mad(x,constant=1)/mm
tr &lt;- range(t,1/t)
madrand &lt;- madrand/mm
hist(madrand,n=200)
abline(v=mad(x,constant=1)/mm,col=3)
abline(v=1/(mad(x,constant=1)/mm),col=3)

(pvalue &lt;- (sum(madrand &lt;= tr[1])+sum(madrand &gt;= tr[2]))/nrand)
</code></pre>

<p>This produces a p-value of 0.114 (with a binomial standard error of 0.001); the histogram looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1yA3.png"" alt=""histogram of scaled mad of smaller sample""></p>

<p>[This looks 'rough' like I haven't sampled enough. Not so - the exact permutation distribution will look like this too; it's a result of using a median (of the absolute deviations from the median) on small samples -- the resulting statistic has a somewhat ""clumpy"" distribution even though the original data was continuous.]</p>

<p>If I'd been clever I'd have used a constant in the calls to <code>mad</code> of <code>1/mm</code>.</p>

<p>If we wanted to retain the scale of the mad in our results, we could still do the other tail by computing <code>mm^2/mad(x,constant=1)</code> as the cutoff and get the same resulting p-value.</p>

<p>Hopefully that's clear enough, but I can elaborate if needed.</p>

<p>The ratio of mads that I originally discussed can be done almost as easily - the sampling will be slower (it will take maybe twice as long to run) but the fiddling around at the end would be simpler.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: If you're not wedded to the mad, the package exactRankTests has some alternative robust permutation tests of equality of spread.</p>

58840,23343.0,1,,,,Correct calculation of effect size after Friedman test in a skewed population,<nonparametric><effect-size>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I have some data that compares behaviour in four conditions (repeated measures)(I have several different behavioural variables and each behaviour gets analysed separately, and the behaviours are currently in % of time format). The behavioural variables are very non-normal, even after transformation. So I have run Friedman tests for the omnibus tests (friedman.test in R). For posthocs I have used friedman from the Agricolae package, but I would also like to report effect sizes. I am not sure which is the correct calculation to use because the data is not only non-normal, but also very positively skewed. I have tried the rFromWilcox function from Field but I am not sure it is the right one to use. Also I am getting r results such as -0.564NULL.
I am quite new to doing my own analysis, but keen to learn, so please don't be offended if I haven't phrased something quite right. </p>

<p>@Michael: I am trying to determine if certain behaviours occur more or less often under the different conditions, and where those differences are (nothing too deep). Two similar but different treatments are applied between condition one and two, and between three and four. I am predicting that there will be certain changes (some behaviours will increase and some will decrease) between all conditions but particularly between one and two, and three and four. My posthocs test between all pair combinations and I have used a Bonferroni correction. I was planning on reporting the summary stats, for each condition for each behaviour, the test statistic and p value, and posthoc results where Friedman is significant, and effect sizes on those posthocs. </p>

58843,5448.0,2,,58822.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>Let's consider a very simple model: <span class=""math-container"">$y = \beta x + e$</span>, with an L1 penalty on <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta}$</span> and a least-squares loss function on <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{e}$</span>.  We can expand the expression to be minimized as:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$\min y^Ty -2 y^Tx\hat{\beta} + \hat{\beta} x^Tx\hat{\beta} + 2\lambda|\hat{\beta}|$</span></p>

<p>Keep in mind this is a univariate example, with <span class=""math-container"">$\beta$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$x$</span> being scalars, to show how LASSO can send a coefficient to zero. This can be generalized to the multivariate case.</p>

<p>Let us assume the least-squares solution is some <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta} &gt; 0$</span>, which is equivalent to assuming that <span class=""math-container"">$y^Tx &gt; 0$</span>, and see what happens when we add the L1 penalty.  With <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta}&gt;0$</span>, <span class=""math-container"">$|\hat{\beta}| = \hat{\beta}$</span>, so the penalty term is equal to <span class=""math-container"">$2\lambda\beta$</span>.  The derivative of the objective function w.r.t. <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta}$</span> is:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$-2y^Tx +2x^Tx\hat{\beta} + 2\lambda$</span>  </p>

<p>which evidently has solution <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta} = (y^Tx - \lambda)/(x^Tx)$</span>.  </p>

<p>Obviously by increasing <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda$</span> we can drive <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta}$</span> to zero (at <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda = y^Tx$</span>).   However, once <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta} = 0$</span>, increasing <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda$</span> won't drive it negative, because, writing loosely, the instant <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta}$</span> becomes negative, the derivative of the objective function changes to:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$-2y^Tx +2x^Tx\hat{\beta} - 2\lambda$</span></p>

<p>where the flip in the sign of <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda$</span> is due to the absolute value nature of the penalty term; when <span class=""math-container"">$\beta$</span> becomes negative, the penalty term becomes equal to <span class=""math-container"">$-2\lambda\beta$</span>, and taking the derivative w.r.t. <span class=""math-container"">$\beta$</span> results in <span class=""math-container"">$-2\lambda$</span>.  This leads to the solution <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta} = (y^Tx + \lambda)/(x^Tx)$</span>, which is obviously inconsistent with <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta} &lt; 0$</span> (given that the least squares solution <span class=""math-container"">$&gt; 0$</span>, which implies <span class=""math-container"">$y^Tx &gt; 0$</span>, and <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda &gt; 0$</span>).  There is an increase in the L1 penalty AND an increase in the squared error term (as we are moving farther from the least squares solution) when moving <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta}$</span> from <span class=""math-container"">$0$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$ &lt; 0$</span>, so we don't, we just stick at <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta}=0$</span>.</p>

<p>It should be intuitively clear the same logic applies, with appropriate sign changes, for a least squares solution with <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta} &lt; 0$</span>.  </p>

<p>With the least squares penalty <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda\hat{\beta}^2$</span>, however, the derivative becomes:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$-2y^Tx +2x^Tx\hat{\beta} + 2\lambda\hat{\beta}$</span></p>

<p>which evidently has solution <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta} = y^Tx/(x^Tx + \lambda)$</span>.  Obviously no increase in <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda$</span> will drive this all the way to zero.  So the L2 penalty can't act as a variable selection tool without some mild ad-hockery such as ""set the parameter estimate equal to zero if it is less than <span class=""math-container"">$\epsilon$</span>"".  </p>

<p>Obviously things can change when you move to multivariate models, for example, moving one parameter estimate around might force another one to change sign, but the general principle is the same: the L2 penalty function can't get you all the way to zero, because, writing very heuristically, it in effect adds to the ""denominator"" of the expression for <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\beta}$</span>, but the L1 penalty function can, because it in effect adds to the ""numerator"".  </p>

<p>The data show a clear seasonality:</p>

<pre><code>plot(y)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ULyKM.png"" alt=""Data""></p>

<p>Take advantage of this by slicing the data into annual (or possibly biennial) groups.  Within each group compute resistant descriptors of their typical value and their spread.  Good choices are based on the 5-letter summary, consisting of the median (which splits the data into upper and lower halves), the medians of the two halves (the ""hinges"" or ""fourths""), and the extremes.  Because the extremes are not resistant to outliers, use the difference of the hinges to represent the spread.  (This ""fourth-spread"" is the length of a box in a properly constructed box-and-whisker plot.)</p>

<pre><code>spread &lt;- function(x) {
  n &lt;- length(x)
  n.med &lt;- (n + 1)/2
  n.fourth &lt;- (floor(n.med) + 1)/2
  y &lt;- sort(x)[c(floor(n.fourth), ceiling(n.fourth), 
               floor(n+1 - n.fourth), ceiling(n+1 - n.fourth))]

}

z &lt;- split(x, years)

</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZKSp.png"" alt=""Raw boxplots""></p>

<p><em>The boxplots clearly get longer over time as the level of the data rises.  This heteroscedasticity complicates analyses and interpretations.  Often a power transformation can reduce or remove the heteroscedasticity altogether.</em></p>

<p>A <em>spread versus level plot</em> shows whether a power transformation (which includes the logarithm) will be helpful for <em>stabilizing the spread</em> within the groups and suggests an appropriate value for the power: it is directly related to the slope of the spread-vs.-level plot on log-log scales.</p>

<pre><code>z.med &lt;- unlist(lapply(z, median))
z.spread &lt;- unlist(lapply(z, spread))
fit &lt;- lm(log(z.spread) ~ log(z.med))
plot(log(z.med), log(z.spread), xlab=""Log Level"", ylab=""Log Spread"",

abline(fit, lwd=2, col=""Red"")
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dSrJL.png"" alt=""Spread vs level plot""></p>

<p><em>This plot shows good linearity and no large outliers, attesting to a fairly regular relationship between spread and level throughout the time period.</em></p>

<p><strong>When the fitted slope is $p$, the power to use is $\lambda=1-p$.</strong>  Upon applying the suggested power transformation, the spread is (approximately) constant regardless of the level (and therefore regardless of the year):</p>

<pre><code>lambda &lt;- 1 - coef(fit)[2]
boxplot(lapply(z, function(u) u^lambda), names=(min(years):max(years))+1976, 
        ylab=paste(""y^"", round(lambda, 2), sep=""""),

<pre><code>plot(y^lambda, main= ""Re-expressed Values"", ylab=paste(""y^"", round(lambda, 2), sep=""""))
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ojozN.png"" alt=""Plot of re-expressed values""></p>

<p>Often, powers that are reciprocals of small integers have useful or natural interpretations.  Here, $\lambda = 0.32$ is so close to $1/3$ that it may as well be the cube root.  In practice, one might choose to use the cube root, or perhaps round it to the even simpler fraction $1/2$ and take the square root, or sometimes go all the way to the logarithm (which corresponds to $\lambda = 0$).</p>

<hr>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>In this example, the spread-versus-level plot (by virtue of its approximate linearity and lack of outliers) has shown that a power transformation will effectively stabilize the spread of the data and has automatically suggested the power to use.  Although powers can be computed using various methods, none of the standard methods provides the insight or diagnostic power afforded by the spread-versus-level plot.  This should be in the toolkit of every data analyst.</p>

58846,21762.0,2,,58798.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>This answer will not be very complete.</p>

<p>1) If the performance scores are reliable (in the sense that they do not change considerably when measured repeatedly within worker), then there is absolutely no point in doing statistical inference (i.e. estimates, tests, confidence intervals) about population parameters, because your sample is equivalent to the corresponding population. Your descriptive presentation of means and variances could be complemented by adding medians, quartiles and boxplots etc.</p>

<p>2) If the performance scores are not very reliable, then you could think of a very simple model of the form
$$
\text{Performance} = \alpha + \beta \cdot \text{Gender} + \varepsilon
$$
with Gender = 1 if female and 0 if male. The random error $\varepsilon$ accounts for the fact that performance varies within person (depending on day, mood etc.) and that the true ""gender-effect"" $\beta$, i.e. the true average overperformance of women, is not exactly $\hat\beta =56.10 - 26.12 = 29.98$ but might change from day to day. With a two-sample t-test (with Welch-correction for unequal variance) you might test whether $\beta \ne 0$. If the p-value is below 5%, you can assert with 95% confidence that women systematically outperform men. (We could now discuss about whether we should pick an other two-sample test or log transform the data etc.)</p>

<p>3) As quite always when men are compared to women, the question of confounding raises: Is the difference really due to gender or can it be explained at least partially by other factors such as age? It's possible that in your company, women are typically older than men, which could already partially explain the difference in performance. One simple way to try to adjust for confounding is to modify the simple model from 2) to
$$
\text{Performance} = \alpha + \beta' \cdot \text{Gender} + \gamma \cdot \text{Age} + \varepsilon
$$
and infer about the age-corrected gender effect $\beta'$ by linear regression.</p>

<p>An alternative to the modelling approach is matching by age followed by a paired t-test (or similar). This also adjusts for potential age-confounding but leads to another estimated ""gender-effect"" $\hat \beta''$. Depending on the variability of the performance difference between pairs (which is directly linked to the intra-pair correlation) and the difference between $\hat \beta$ and $\hat \beta''$, the power of such test is higher or lower than the two-sample test in 2). </p>

<p>Summa summarum: Matching leads to inference about a confounder-adjusted effect of gender, whereas the unmatched comparison infers about the ""crude"" gender effect without considering any confounders. Both parameters might be interesting, so you could easily summarize both of them.</p>

This might sound a dumb question but I am really confused about it. According to Bayes' rule we do have the following:
$$p(\theta|X)=\frac{p(\theta)p(X|\theta)}{\int{p(\theta)p(X|\theta)d\theta}}$$I know that probability density function can be greater than one in general but it seems to me because there exist discrete summations of denominator integral which would is greater than the nominator, therefore posterior probability density function cannot be greater than one in any point. Is this correct?!</p>

<p>To explain reasoning a bit in more detail:</p>

<p>Suppose we are interested in $p(\theta=\theta_0|X)$ and we know that:
$$\int{p(\theta)p(X|\theta)}d\theta\approx\sum\limits_{n}{p(\theta_i)p(X|\theta_i)}$$ but now only consider the summations which include $p(\theta_0)p(\theta_0|X)$. Then the denominator will obviously be larger than the nominator.</p>

And I am big fan of your home-made measurement framework, which is super cool... so why on earth does it matter what you call ""averaging the integrals""?</p>

<p>In case you are interested in some broader positioning of your work, what you would like to do is often referred to as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection"" rel=""nofollow"">Anomaly detection</a>. In its simplest setting it involves comparing a value in a time-series against the standard deviation of the previous values. The rule is then if $$x[n] &gt; \alpha SD(x[1:n-1]) =&gt; x[n]\text{ is outlier}$$
where $x[n]$ is the $n^{th}$ value in the series, $SD(x[1:n-1])$ is the standard deviation of all previous values between the $1^{st}$ and $(n-1)^{th}$ value, and $\alpha$ is some suitable parameter you pick, such as 1, or 2, depending on how sensitive you want the detector to be. You can of course adapt this formula to work only locally (on some interval of length $h$),
$$x[n] &gt; \alpha SD(x[n-h-1:n-1]) =&gt; x[n]\text{ is outlier}$$</p>

<p>If I understood correctly, you are looking for a way to automate the testing of your devices, that is, declare a device as good/faulty after it performed the entire test (drew the entire diagonal). In that case simply consider the above formulas as comparing $x[n]$ against the standard deviation of all values.</p>

<p>There are also other rules you might want to consider for the purpose of classifying a device as faulty:</p>

<ul>
<li>if any deviation (delta) is greater than some multiple of the SD of all deltas</li>
<li>if the square sum of the deviations is larger than a certain threshold</li>
<li>if the ratio of the sum of the positive and negative deltas is not approximately equal (which might be useful if you prefer smaller errors in both directions rather than a strong bias in a single direction)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course you can find more rules and concatenate them using boolean logic, but I think you can get very far with the three above. </p>

<p>Last but not least, once you set it up, you will need to test the classifier (a classifier is a system/model mapping an input to a class, in your case the data of each device, to either ""good"", or ""faulty""). Create a testing set by manually labelling the performance of each device. Then look into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"" rel=""nofollow"">ROC</a>, which basically tells you the offset between how many devices your system correctly picks up out of the returned, in relation to how many of the faulty devices it picks up.</p>

Since $c_{ij}$ is a random variable with cdf $F$, we have that $F(\Lambda)$ is another way of writing $P(c_{ij} &lt; \Lambda)$, or in other words the probability that the compliance cost will be less than the cost of not complying. Or in other words, the probability that the company will comply.</p>

<p>So saying that $F(\Lambda) &lt;1$ is just saying that the probability that the company will comply is less than $1$. Similarly, $F(\Lambda) &lt; 0.4$ means that there is less than a $40\%$ chance that the company will comply.</p>

<p>For your questions in the comments about how to derive (3) and (4), to get (4) you observe that the only way in which a company can do more damage under dealing is if it's in category $\beta$ on page 365 of the paper. This is the same as $\mathrm{max}\{c_{i1}, c_{i2}\} &lt; \Lambda$. Since $c_{i1}$ and $c_{i2}$ are independent, the probability of both of them being less than $\Lambda$ is
$$P(c_{i1}, c_{i2} &lt; \Lambda) = P(c_{i1} &lt;\Lambda)P(c_{i2} &lt; \Lambda) = F(\Lambda)^2$$
which gives (4).</p>

<p>To get (3), the company needs to be in category $\alpha$ on page 364, which means that one $c_{ij}$ has to be between $\Lambda$ and $2\Lambda$ and the other $c_{ij}$ has to be greater than $\Lambda$. The desired probability is
$$\alpha(\Lambda) = P((\Lambda &lt; c_{i1} &lt; 2\Lambda \text{ and } c_{i2} &gt; \Lambda) \text{ OR } (\Lambda &lt; c_{i2} &lt; 2\Lambda \text{ and } c_{i1} &gt; \Lambda))$$
but when you have the ``OR"" of two events you have to take into account that they might have outcomes in common, so you need to use the formula $P(X \text{ or } Y)=P(X) + P(Y) - P(X \text{ and } Y)$. Here, this gives you
$$\alpha(\Lambda) = P(\Lambda &lt; c_{i1} &lt; 2\Lambda \text{ and } c_{i2} &gt; \Lambda) + P(\Lambda &lt; c_{i2} &lt; 2\Lambda \text{ and } c_{i1} &gt; \Lambda) - P(\Lambda &lt; c_{i1} &lt; 2\Lambda \text{ and } c_{i2} &gt; \Lambda \text{ and } \Lambda &lt; c_{i2} &lt; 2\Lambda \text{ and } c_{i1} &gt; \Lambda)$$
which using independence reduces to
$$P(\Lambda &lt; c_{i1} &lt; 2\Lambda)P(c_{i2} &gt; \Lambda) + P(\Lambda &lt; c_{i2} &lt; 2\Lambda)P(c_{i1} &gt; \Lambda) - P(\Lambda &lt; c_{i1} &lt; 2\Lambda)P(\Lambda &lt; c_{i2} &lt; 2\Lambda)$$

<p>However, I don't get the same answer when I condition on $X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}$ and use the formula for conditional variance:

The conditional copula $C_u$ (conditioned on $u$) is given through the partial derivative: $$ C_u(v) = \frac{\partial}{\partial u} C(u,v) $$
Hence, one needs to solve $C_u(v)=y$ for $v$ to get the desired pair $(u,v)$. For a ""custom made"" copula, one has to calculate its partial derivative and its quasi-inverse. In case the copula is not completely ""custom made"" it might already be covered in other statistical software.

<p>I understand that you ask which of the original measurement channels to include into the modeling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is such a decision sensible for your data?</strong><br />
E.g. I work mainly with spectroscopic data, for which PLS is frequently and successfully used. Well measured spectra have a high correlation betweeen neighbour variates and the relevant information in spectroscopic data sets tends to be spread out over many variates. PLS is well suited for such data, but deciding on a variate-to-variate basis which variates to use for the model IMHO is usually not appropriate (decisions about inclusion/exclusion of spectral ranges based on spectroscopic knowledge about the application is IMHO a far better approach).</li>
<li>If for your data and application variable selection is a natural choice, <strong>is PLS the regularization technique you want?</strong><br />
You may want to read the sections about regularization  (3.4 - 3.6) in the <a href=""http://www-stat.stanford.edu/%7Etibs/ElemStatLearn/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Elements of Statistical Learning</a> where PLS as a regularization is compared to other regularization approaches. My point here is that in contrast to e.g. the Lasso, PLS is a regularization technique that does <em>not</em> tend to completely exclude variables from the model. I'd thus say that PLS is probably more suitable for data where this behaviour is sensible, but in that case variable selection is not a natural choice (e.g. spectroscopic data).</li>
<li><strong>Does your data contain enough information for such a data-driven model optimization?</strong> Doing a t-test for each input variable is a massive multiple testing situation.<br />
<em>IMHO the main point of PLS (or other regularization techniques) is to avoid the need for such a variable selection.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Remark to Step 2:</h2>
<p>If you build a linear regression model in PCA score space, that is usually called principal component regression (PCR) in chemometrics. It is not the same as a PLS model.</p>
<h2>How to find out which variates are used by the PCA/PLS model?</h2>
<p>There are several ways to approach this question. Obviously, variates where the PCA loadings or PLS weights are 0 do not enter the model. Whether it is sufficient to look at the loadings or whether you need to go a step further depends on your data: if the data set is not standardized you may want to calculate how much each variate &quot;contributes&quot; to the respective PCA/PLS score.<br />
Literature where we did that with LDA (works just the same way): <a href=""http://softclassval.r-forge.r-project.org/2011/2011-07-01-ABC-Glioma-paper.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C.

Chem., 400 (2011), 2801 - 2816.</a> The linked page has both links to the official web page and my manuscript.</p>
<p>You can also derive e.g. bootstrap distributions of the loadings (or the contributions) and have a look at them. For PCR and PLS coefficients that is straightforward, as the Y variable automatically &quot;aligns&quot; the coefficients. PCA and PLS scores need some more care, as e.g. flipping of the directions needs to be taken into account, and you may decide to treat models as equivalent where the scores which are then used for further modeling are just rotated or scaled  versions of each other. Thus, you may want to align the scores first e.g. by Procrustes analysis. The paper linked above also discusses this (for LDA, but again, the ideas apply to the other bilinear models as well).</p>
<p>Last but not least, you need to be careful not to overinterprete the models, and you can have situations where important variates have coefficients frequently touching the zero mark in the bootstrap experiments if you have correlation between variates. However, ehat you can or cannot conclude will depend on your type of data, though.</p>

<p>However, there are related situations as well, where the the ""reality"" isn't that clear, and the assumption of having really distinct classes is not met: bordeline cases may be a ""physical"" reality (see below for papers about an application where we met such a condition).  </p>

<p>There is one <strong>crucial assumption for semi-supervised classifers</strong> that you need to make sure is met: the assumption that <strong>in feature space, class boundaries come along with low sample density</strong>. This is referred to as the cluster assumption.<br>

<p>I fully agree with you that excluding the borderline cases is often a bad idea: 
 by removing all difficult cases you end up with an artificially easy problem. IMHO it is even worse that excluding borderline cases usually does not stop with model training, but the borderline cases are also excluded from testing, thus testing the model only with easy cases. With that you'd not even realize that the model does not perform well with borderline cases. </p>

So, watch out: you won't get anything out of AIC or similar or dissimilar figures of merit that is not a strict consequence of how they are defined. That no doubt is obvious, but it is important. </p></li>

<p>Because $X$ isn't regarded an argument of $M$, $t$ is. If it were $M(X,t)$, then we'd write $\partial$, but it's $M_X(t)$, so we write $d$. This isn't some accident of notation, however - it really is a function of $t$ we're dealing with, though calculated with respect to the distribution of $X$. Inside the integral/sum, $x$ is actually a <em>dummy variable</em>; it could as easily be represented by $u$, or any other dummy, and $M$ is certainly not a function of the dummy variable in any sense. You might think of $X$ like an indexing variable (since it determines which $M$ you get), but if $M$ is to be regarded as a function of something to do with $X$, it's really $F_X$ (through $dF$) that $M$ is a function of.</p>

58900,750.0,2,,58219.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I will walk through how I generated the exact statistics for the $\chi^2$ distribution and (hopefully) update later with a paper that gives tables for the exact distributions and where the exact distribution converges to the theoretical $\chi^2$ with $6$ degrees of freedom. Ditto for the K-S and Kuiper distributions that ttnphns mentions.</p>

<p>So the steps to generate the exact distributions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate all potential combinations of outcomes allocating crimes into the $7$ weekday bins. The total number of combinations ends up being $\binom{M + N - 1}{M - 1}$ where $M = 7$ weekday bins and $N$ equals the number of crimes observed.</li>
<li>For each of the combinations, calculate the probability of observing that outcome under the null hypothesis. Here the null is that each crime has a multinomial distribution in which the weekdays are the outcomes and are equi-probable (e.g. each day has a probability of $1/7$ of being selected).</li>
<li>Generate the test statistic for that set of observations.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this information you can generate critical values for the test distributions under the null. So If you observe $3$ crimes, with two occurring on Monday and one on Tuesday, the probability of that event under the null is:</p>

<p>$$Pr(\text{Mon.} = 2, \text{Tues.} = 1) = \frac{3!}{2!1!} \cdot ({P_m}^2)({P_t}^1) = 0.00874635568513119$$</p>

<p>Where $P_m$ and $P_t$ symbolize the probability of an event on Monday and Tuesday respectively, and $P_m = P_t = 1/7$. (If you wanted to generalize to a window in which say spans 10 days, you may want to consider unequal probalities of $2/10$ for the overlapping days and $1/10$ for the others.)</p>

<p>For an example of generating the exact distribution of the test statistic, with three crimes there are only three different possible $\chi^2$ values out of the 84 different combinations (since order doesn't matter for the statistic). The below table symbolizes these potential outcomes. (Just imagine sorting the days of the week so the day of the week with the most events is in the left most column.)</p>

<pre><code>A  B   C
.
.  .
.  ..  ...
</code></pre>

<p>Subsequently, combinations of <code>A</code> appear 7 times, <code>B</code> 42 times, and <code>C</code> 35 times. The below table shows the probabilties of obtaining said $\chi^2$ statistics and how to generate the CDF of the null hypothesis. From here you can see that it is actually possible to reject the null at a .05 critical level if all three events are observed on the same day.</p>

<pre><code>    #  ChiSq    Prob(Sum) CDF
C  35    4         .61    .61
B  42    8.67      .37    .98
A   7   18         .02   1.0 
</code></pre>

<p>Also from the set of all potential combinations you can generate the distributions under various alternative hypotheses, and this allows you to evaluate the power of the test under those circumstances. So for example for $5$ crimes, the exact $\chi^2$ distribution has a $.05$ critical value at $10.4$. So for an alternative hypothesis of data having positive probability in <em>only</em> two days, you have 100% power (i.e. the only observable $\chi^2$ values if 5 crimes occur in 2 or fewer days of the week is over $10.4$).</p>

<p>The image below shows the CDFs for the exact $\chi^2$ distribution with $5$ crimes in $7$ weekday bins (in light grey lines), CDFs for different alternative hypotheses in dark grey lines, and the critical value $\chi^2$ highlighted with a red guideline. The alternative hypotheses are for differing numbers of days that are equi-probable for the crimes to occur on for $1$ to $4$ days during the week. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KLZY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You can see from this chart even for an alternative of equi-probable chances over three days for just 5 crimes the power is just under 40%, 1 minus the CDF of the alt. hypothesis where it intersects the critical value. (Earlier I wrote that a tie goes to rejecting the null, but that would be incorrect as the Type 1 error would be inflated to .39 instead of .02 in my 3 crimes example.)</p>

58902,17573.0,2,,58622.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>You asked for an algebraic answer to 1, and it is given below.  However, a non-algebraic answer would be much better, so that is given first.  </p>

<p>The usual technique used to run linear regressions is called Ordinary <em>Least</em> Squares (OLS).  The formula you give above is the formula for the OLS estimator.  However, the formula you give above is not the definition of the OLS estimator.  The definition of the OLS estimator is ""that coefficient vector, $\hat{\beta}$, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals.""  First, verbally . . .</p>

<p>Define the number of observations as $N$, so that each of the $\delta$ and $\alpha$ models have $N$ observations, and the $\beta$ model has $2N$.  Consider the $\delta$ and $\alpha$ which solve the first two OLS problems you pose above, and ask, do they (transformed as you have transformed them) solve the third, pooled, $\beta$, OLS problem?  Well, think about that third problem's objective function $\sum_{i=1}^{2N} (Y_i-\hat{Y}_i)^2$.  We know that $\hat{\alpha}$ minimizes the first $N$ terms (definition of OLS) and has no effect on the last $N$ terms (by inspection).  We know that $\hat{\delta}$ minimizes the last $N$ terms (definition of OLS) and has no effect on the first $N$ terms (by inspection).  Last, there are ""enough"" $\beta$ such that the $\alpha$ and $\delta$ may be adjusted independently in the third problem.  That is essentially a proof that the OLS estimators have to be exactly the same (again up to your transformation).  The proof is not completely formal and explicit, but it's not hard from here to make it so.</p>

<p>To your question 2, yes this result is true much more generally.  For any estimator defined by an optimization problem (any ""M Estimator,"" like maximum likelihood for example), there is a result like this. The key requirements are that the parameter spaces of the pooled and separate models are ""the same"" up to an invertible transformation (like the one you gave to transform $\alpha$ and $\delta$ to $\beta$) and that the objective function of the pooled model can be decomposed (linearly or multiplicatively) into non-interacting parts corresponding (up to an increasing transformation) to the objective functions of the separate problems.  This is a lot of models.</p>

<p>The kind of argument I give above is incredibly useful when you are using any kind of M-estimator.  For example, it is a famous result for OLS that if you re-scale (change the units of) one of the $X$ variables, that its coefficient will be rescaled by OLS in an exactly offsetting way and that nothing else about the OLS estimator will change. This can be proved by a fairly tedious algebra exercise or by a very brief optimization argument like the one I gave above.  The result is not just true for OLS, though.  Any M estimator which has the $X$ multiplied against a coefficient will have this magic re-scaling property as well.</p>

<p>Now, to the algebraic demonstration.  Changing your notation a little for clarity, start by comparing estimating these two equations by OLS:
\begin{align}
Y_1 &amp;= X_1\delta + \epsilon_1 \\
Y_2 &amp;= X_1\alpha + \epsilon_2
\end{align}
With estimating this equation by OLS:
\begin{align}
\left(\begin{array}{r} Y_1 \\ Y_2 \end{array} \right) &amp;=
\left[\begin{array}{r r} X_1 &amp; 0 \\ X_1 &amp; X_1 \end{array} 
\right]
\left(\begin{array}{r} \gamma_1 \\ \gamma_2 \end{array}
\right)
+ \left(\begin{array}{r} \epsilon_1 \\ \epsilon_2 \end{array}
\right) \\ \strut \\
Y &amp;= X\gamma + \epsilon
\end{align}
My $\gamma_1$ is your $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ stacked up and etc.
\begin{align}
\hat{\gamma} &amp;= (X'X)^{-1}X'Y \\ \strut \\
             &amp;= 
\left[\begin{array}{r r} X_1'X_1 &amp; 0 \\ 2X_1'X_1 &amp; X_1'X_1 \end{array} 
\right]^{-1}
\left(\begin{array}{r} X_1'Y_1 \\ X_1'Y_1 + X_1'Y_2 \end{array}

&amp;= 
\left[\begin{array}{r r} (X_1'X_1)^{-1} &amp; 0 \\ -2(X_1'X_1)^{-1} &amp; (X_1'X_1)^{-1} \end{array}

I'm interested in restrictions on $\Sigma$. An unrestricted $\Sigma$ is equivalent to taking
$$
Y_j = \alpha_j + \sum_{\ell = 1} ^ {j - 1} \phi_{\ell j} Y_{j-\ell} + \varepsilon_j
$$
with $\varepsilon_j \sim N(0, \sigma_j)$. </p>

<p>This is typically not done since it requires estimating $O(J^2)$ covariance parameters. A model is ""lag-$k$"" if we take
$$
Y_j = \alpha_j + \sum_{\ell = 1} ^ k \phi_{\ell j} Y_{j - \ell} + \varepsilon_j,
$$
i.e. we only use the preceding $k$ terms to predict $Y_j$ from the history.</p>

<p>What I'd really like to do is use some kind of shrinkage idea to zero out some of the $\phi_{\ell j}$, like the LASSO. But the thing is, I also would like the method I use to prefer models which are lag-$k$ for some $k$; I'd like to penalize higher order lags more than lower order lags. I think this is something we would particularly like to do given that the predictors are highly correlated. </p>

<p>An additional issue is that if (say) $\phi_{35}$ is shrunk to $0$ I would also like it if $\phi_{36}$ is shrunk to $0$, i.e. the same lag is used in all of the conditional distributions. </p>

<p>I could speculate on this, but I don't want to reinvent the wheel. Is there any LASSO techniques designed to get at this sort of problem? Am I better off just doing something else entirely, like stepwise inclusion of lag orders? Since my model space is small, I could even use an $L_0$ penalty on this problem I guess?</p>

<p>the same logic for the second line but, considering ""goat"" vs. ""cat"" with ($b_{24}$=-47.72585).  </p>

What you appear to be trying to do is to <em>predict</em> a future event. For this, you need a little more structure on your problem. In particular, a confidence interval is insufficient. What you really need is a <em>distribution</em> of possible head probabilities and probabilities of rolling 1. Then, you need to calculate the probability as such:</p>
<p>Let <span class=""math-container"">$C$</span> be the outcome of the coin toss and <span class=""math-container"">$X$</span> be the results of the die roll, <span class=""math-container"">$f_H(p)$</span> isthe density function on the probability of heads (i.e., <span class=""math-container"">$p$</span>) and <span class=""math-container"">$f_{1|C=H}(q)$</span> is the density function for the probability of rolling a 1 (i.e, <span class=""math-container"">$q$</span>) given that you got a head. Therefore,</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$P(X=1)=E[1_{C=H}1_{X=1|C=H}]=E[1_{C=H}]E[1_{X=1|C=H}]$</span> where <span class=""math-container"">$1_{C=H}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$1_{X=1|C=H}$</span> are indicator functions that take value 1 when the event in subscript happens, and 0 otherwise. Conditional independence between the coin toss and die roll allow you to multiply expected values.</p>
<p>Now, <span class=""math-container"">$E[1_{C=H}]E[1_{X=1|C=H}]=\int\limits_0^1 \int\limits_0^1pf_H(p)qf_{1|C=H}(q)dqdp$</span>. In other words, you multiply the expected values of the distributions on P(heads) and P(X=1|Heads). So, you will need more info to solve your problem as formulated.</p>

<p>An example of an experiment I have performed is to measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (using a fluorescent dye) in these cells using a confocal microscope.
This experiment was repeated on three independent occasions.</p>

<p>On each experimental day, the intensity of the laser which I used (the laser ""gain"") varies therefore I cannot combine all experimental days without expressing the dye intensity of each knockdown clone as a percent of the control ""scrambled"" clone (e.g. control = 100% mean intensity; knockdown clone 1 = 50% mean intensity). </p>

<p>Therefore, <strong>I need to test for a difference in means between my control scrambled clone and each of the knockdown clones</strong>, where my control scrambled clone is set to 100% dye intensity on each experimental day and my knockdown clones are normalised to this control. Therefore, my control has no variance (100% for all three experimental days) while my knockdown clones do have variance. </p>

<p>I know an ANOVA would not be feasible given the difference in variance. I will look into the procedure suggested by Michael Lew, but <strong>would a t-test be unacceptable as well?</strong> (I have seen papers using ANOVA and t-tests in these circumstances, but in spite of this I am assuming these should not be used).

58914,18690.0,1,,,,Variable selection (automated),<feature-selection>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I was wondering whether the following mechanical selection procedure will result in a possible bias. First let me introduce the first procedure, we start with a model and only look at the t-value and possibly correct them for it (heteroskedasticity / autocorrelation). We then only add variables into our final model that are significant. However I am well aware this gives us a bias with F-test, since even though some variables can be insignificant, they can be jointly significant.</p>

<p>However if we also take that into account, whether adding that variable gives us a ""sensible"" subset to do a F-test on and only add them if they give a significant result (indicating joinly significance), this would then actually be a pretty good automated method or does this give some bias? Will anything happen that we do <strong>not</strong> like to have? </p>

<p>You can see that with this much data we don't have much difference between the two estimates, but there is some. </p>

<p>Now for your question.  It's not clear whether you want the distance in standard errors where the standard errors are for fitted values or for prediction, so I'll show both. Let us say we are doing this for the value $x = 1$ and the target value (green dot) $y = 1.1$):</p>

<p>Now I'll show you how to do the residual variance calculation.  First, if your weights aren't normalized, you will have problems:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Note how that residual standard error has gone way down and the prediction confidence interval has really changed, but the coefficient estimates themselves have not.  This is because the calculation for the residual s.e. divides by the residual degrees of freedom (998 in this case) without regard for the scale of the weights.  Here's the calculation, mostly lifted from the interior of <code>summary.lm</code>:</p>

<pre><code>w &lt;- wtd_lm$weights
r &lt;- wtd_lm$residuals
rss &lt;- sum(w * r^2)
sqrt(rss / wtd_lm$df)
[1] 0.6707338
</code></pre>

<p>which you can see matches the residual s.e. in the previous printout.  </p>

<p>Here's how you ought to do this calculation if you find yourself in a position where you need to do it by hand, so to speak:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; rss_w &lt;- sum(w*r^2)/mean(w)
&gt; sqrt(rss_w / wtd_lm$df)
[1] 1.019937

<p>However, normalizing the weights up front takes care of the need to divide by <code>mean(w)</code> and the various <code>lm</code>-related calculations come out correctly without any further manual intervention.</p>

I've written the solution in R, but you could use any other programming language, say Python or Ruby.</p>

<p>I'm first going to describe how to simulate one draw. First let's define the tile frequencies.</p>

## 27 Levels: _ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r ... z

<p>Then encode the word as a vector of letter counts.</p>

<pre class=""lang-r prettyprint-override""><code>word &lt;- ""boot""

<p>Now draw a sample of seven tiles and encode them in the same way as the word.</p>

<pre class=""lang-r prettyprint-override""><code>tile_sample &lt;- table(sample(tiles, size=7))

<p>At last, calculate what letters are missing...</p>

<p>... and sum the number of missing letters and subtract the number of available blanks. If the result is zero or less we succeeded in spelling the word.</p>

<pre class=""lang-r prettyprint-override""><code>sum(missing) - tile_sample[""blank""] &lt;= 0
## FALSE
</code></pre>

<p>In this particular case we didn't though... Now we just need to repeat this many times and calculate the percentage of successful draws. All this is done by the following R function:</p>

<pre class=""lang-r prettyprint-override""><code>word_prob &lt;- function(word, reps = 50000) {
  tile_freq &lt;- c(2, 9 ,2 ,2 ,4 ,12,2 ,3 ,2 ,9 ,1 ,1 ,4 ,2 ,6 ,8 ,2 ,1 ,6 ,4 ,6 ,4 ,2 ,2 ,1 ,2 ,1)

A type 1 error is rejecting a true null hypothesis. In this case we have a p-value of 0.028. This means that among all the hypothesis tests with this p-value ever conducted, roughly 3 out of a hundred will reject a true null hypothesis. By construction, this would be one of those cases. Frequentists accept that sometimes they'll reject true null hypothesis or retain false null hypothesis (Type 2 errors), they've never claimed otherwise. Moreover, they precisely quantify the frequency of their erroneous inferences in the long run.</p>

<p>Perhaps, a less confusing way of looking at this result is to exchange the roles of the hypotheses. Since the two hypotheses are simple, this is easy to do. If the null is that the sun went nova, then the p-value is 35/36=0.972. This means that this is no evidence against the hypothesis that the sun went nova, so we can't reject it based on this result. This seems more reasonable. If you are thinking. Why would anybody assume the sun went nova? I would ask you. Why would anybody carry out such an experiment if the very thought of the sun exploding seems ridiculous?</p>

<p>I think this just shows that one has to assess the usefulness of an experiment beforehand. This experiment, for example, would be completely useless because it tests something we already know simply from looking up to the sky (Which I'm sure produces a p-value that is effectively zero). Designing a good experiment is a requirement to produce good science. If your experiment is poorly designed, then no matter what statistical inference tool you use, your results are unlikely to be useful.</p>

<p>Is there some technique that I can use where it preserves the interaction of snow and temp each month but uses the cumulative effect of all months in a winter to predict survival?</p>

<p>example of what the data looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Year1 survival = 0.9
month      temp     snow
 m1         -5       20
 m2        -15       20
 m3        -20      100
 m4          2      100

Year2 survival = 0.7
month     temp     snow
 m1        -5       20
 m2       -18      110
 m3       -20      100
 m4       -11       20
</code></pre>

<p>Temp was the average temperature for the month, and snow was the sum of all snow in a month.  I'm not sure where the comment about order statistics is going but if it makes a difference daily data is available.</p>

<p>The distribution of the minimum of $n$ independent random variables is </p>

<p>$$F_T(t) = 1-\prod_{i=1}^n[1-F_i(t)]$$</p>

<p>(see the reasoning in <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/220/how-is-the-minimum-of-a-set-of-random-variables-distributed"">this CV post</a>, if you don't know it already)</p>

<p>We differentiate to obtain its density function:</p>

<p>$$f_T(t) =\frac {\partial}{\partial t}F_T(t) = f_1(t)\prod_{i\neq 1}[1-F_i(t)]+...+f_n(t)\prod_{i\neq n}[1-F_i(t)]$$</p>

<p>Using $h_i(t) = \frac {f_i(t)}{(1-F_i(t)} \Rightarrow f_i(t) = h_i(t)(1-F_i(t)) $ and substituting in $f_T(t)$ we have</p>

I'm not trained in statistics, so take this response with a grain of salt. I have used the response below in my real world practice data, so I hope this is helpful.</p>

<p>I'll try to provide a non statistician view of transformation of time series data for Arima modeling. There is no straightforward answer. Since you are interested in knowing which transformation to use, it might be helpful to review why we do transformation.We do transformation for 3 main reasons and there might be ton of other reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Transformation makes the data's linear structure more usable for<br>
ARIMA modeling. </li>
<li>If variance in the data is increasing or changing then transformation of data might be helpful to stabilize the variance in data.</li>
<li>Transformation also makes the errors/residuals in 
    ARIMA model normally distributed which is a requirement in ARIMA modeling proposed by Box-Jenkins.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are several data transformations including Box-Cox, Log, square root, quartic and inverse and other transformations mentioned @irishstat. As with all the statistical methods there is no good guidance/answer on which transformation to select for a particular dataset. </p>

<p>As the famous statistician G.E.P Box said ""All models are wrong but some are useful"", this would apply to the transformations as well ""All <em>transformations</em> are wrong but some are useful"". </p>

<p>The best way to choose a transformation is to experiment. Since you have a long time series, I would hold out the last 12 - 24 months, and build a model using all the transformation and see if a particular transformation is helpful at predicting your out of sample data accurately. Also examine the residuals for normality assumption of your model. Hopefully, this would guide you in choosing an appropriate transformation. You might also want to compare this with non-transformed data and see if the transformation helped your model.</p>

<p>@whuber's excellent graphical representation of your data motivated me to explore this data graphically using a decomposition method. I might  add, R has an excellent decomposition method called STL which would be helpful in identifying patterns that you would normally not notice. For a dataset like this, STL decomposition is helpful in not only selecting an appropriate method for analyzing your data, it might also  be helpful in identifying anomalies such as outliers/level shift/change in seasonality etc., See below. Notice that the remainder (irregular) component of the data, looks like there is stochastic seasonality and the variation is not random, there appears to be a pattern. See also change in level of trend component after 2004/2005 that @whuber is refrencing.</p>

<p>Hopefully this is helpful.</p>

<p>A probabilistic statement is not a statement about the <em>possibility/feasibility</em> of an event. It only reflects our attempt to quantify our uncertainty about it happening.  So when a phenomenon is continuous (or is modeled as one), then our tools and current state of knowledge <em>do not permit us to make a probabilistic statement about it taking a specific value</em>. We can only make such a statement related to a <em>range</em> of values. Of course the usual trick here is to discretize the support, to consider""small"" intervals of values rather than single values. Since continuous random variables bring great benefits and flexibility compared to discrete random variables, this has been found to be a rather small price to pay, perhaps as small as the intervals we are forced to consider.</p>

<p>Draw a real line around zero with a ruler. Now take a sharp dart and let it fall from above randomly on the line(let's assume you will always hit the line and only the lateral positioning matters for the sake of the argument).</p>

<p>However many times you let the dart fall randomly on the line, you will never hit the point zero. Why? Think what is the point zero, think what is its width. And after you recognise that its width is 0, do you still think you can hit it?</p>

<p>Will you be able to hit point 1, or -2? Or any other point you pick on the line for that matter?</p>

<p>To get back to maths, this is the difference between the physical world, and a mathematical concept such as real numbers (represented by the real line in my example). Probability theory has quite a bit more complicated definition of probability than you will see in your lecture. To quantify the probability of events and any combination of their outcomes, you need a probability measure. Both the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_measure"" rel=""nofollow"">Borel measure</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure"" rel=""nofollow"">Lebesgue measure</a> are defined for an interval [a, b] on the real line as:
$$\mu([a,b])=b-a$$
from this definition you can see what happens with the probability if you reduce the interval to a number (setting a = b).</p>

<p>The bottom line is that based on our current definition of probability theory (dating back to Kolmogorov) the fact that an event has 0 probability does not mean it cannot occur.</p>

<pre><code>el &lt;- structure(c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 
2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3), .Dim = c(8L, 3L), .Dimnames = list(NULL,

el
#     i j w

#[4,] 1 2 4
#[5,] 2 2 1
#[6,] 1 3 1
#[7,] 2 3 2
#[8,] 3 3 3
</code></pre>

<p>It captures the facts that state $1$ followed state $1$ (i.e., no transition) four times, state $1$ followed state $2$ twice, and so on. I now capture this same information in the form of a square $3 \times 3$ matrix.</p>

<pre><code>X &lt;- matrix(0,3,3)

#[2,]    2    1    2
#[3,]    3    0    3
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want the elements to represent proportions with respect to the rest of the elements in their own row only. That is, rows should sum to $1$ meaning that in every state there will be some transition with probability $1$ and the individual elements of the row capture the distribution of that probability across all possible next states.</p>

<pre><code>X &lt;- X / rowSums(X)
X
#          [,1]      [,2]      [,3]

<p>These proportions can be taken as the transition probabilities. Here we see that the probability of transitioning from state $1$ to state $3$ is found at location $X_{13}$ and is equal to $0.11$.

Is $M_{X,Y}(s,t)=M_{X,Y}(s,0)⋅M_{X,Y}(0,t)$ both a necessary <em>and sufficient</em> condition for independence of $X$ and $Y$? I checked a couple of textbooks, which only mentioned <em>necessity:</em></p>

<p>Given a joint MGF $M_{X,Y}(s,t)$, this uniquely determines the marginal distributions of $X$ and $Y$ and their MGFs, 
$M_X(s)=M_{X,Y}(s,0)$ and $M_Y(t)=M_{X,Y}(0,t)$. The marginals alone are compatible with many other possible joint distributions, and uniquely determine a joint distribution in which $X$ and $Y$ are independent, with CDF $F_{X,Y}^{\text{ind}}(x,y)=F_X(x) \cdot F_Y(y)$ and MGF:</p>

<p>$$M_{X,Y}^{\text{ind}}(s,t) = M_X(s) \cdot M_Y(t) = M_{X,Y}(s,0)⋅M_{X,Y}(0,t)$$</p>

<p>So if we are given, for our original MGF, that $M_{X,Y}(s,t) = M_{X,Y}(s,0)⋅M_{X,Y}(0,t)$, this is sufficient to show $M_{X,Y}(s,t) = M_{X,Y}^{\text{ind}}(s,t)$. Then by the uniqeness of MGFs, our original joint distribution has $F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_{X,Y}^{\text{ind}}(x,y) = F_X(x) \cdot F_Y(y)$ and $X$ and $Y$ are independent.</p>

I have repeated some of his figures below with slight modification. The left column shows the distribution of p-values expected due to theory for different effect sizes (difference between means/pooled sd) and sample sizes. The horizontal lines mark the &quot;slices&quot; from which we get the likelihood functions shown by the right panels for p=0.50 and p=0.025.</p>

<p>These results are consistent with monte carlo simulations. For this figure I compared two groups with n=10 via t-test at a number of different effect sizes and binned 10,000 p-values into .01 intervals for each effect size. Specifically there was one group with mean=0, sd=1 and a second with a mean that I varied from -4 to 4, also with sd=1.</p>

<p>(The above figures can be directly compared to figures 7/8 from the paper linked above and are very similar, I found the heatmaps more informative than the &quot;clouds&quot; used in that paper and also wished to independently replicate his result.)</p>
<p>If we examine the likelihood functions &quot;indexed&quot; by the p-values, the behaviour of rejecting/accepting hypotheses or ignoring results giving p-values greater than 0.05 based on a cut-off value (either the arbitrary 0.05 used everywhere or determined by cost-benefit) appears to be absurd. Why should I not conclude from the n=100, p=0.5 case that &quot;the current evidence shows that any effect, if present, is small&quot;? Current practice would be to either &quot;accept&quot; there is no effect (hypothesis testing) or say &quot;more data needed&quot; (significance testing). I fail to see why I should do either of those things.</p>
<p>Perhaps when a theory <strong>predicted</strong> a precise point value, then rejecting a hypothesis could make sense. But when the hypotheses are of the form either &quot;mean1=mean2 or mean1!=mean2&quot; I see no value. Under the conditions these tests are often being used randomization does not <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/74350/is-randomization-reliable-with-small-samples?lq=1"">guarantee all confounds are balanced across groups</a> and there should always be the worry of <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/74262/what-examples-of-lurking-variables-in-controlled-experiments-are-there-in-public"">lurking variables</a>, so rejecting  the hypothesis that mean1 exactly equals mean2 has no scientific value as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Are there cases beyond the t-test where this argument would not apply? Am I missing something of value that rejecting a hypothesis with low a priori probability provides to researchers? Ignoring results above an arbitrary cutoff seems to have lead to widespread publication bias. What useful role does ignoring results play for scientists?</p>

<p>Your questions are not entirely clear to me, so I will paraphrase them. If they are not what you had in mind them my answers will be misdirected!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are there situations where rejection of the hypothesis like ""mean1 equals mean2"" is scientifically valuable? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Frequentists would contend that the advantage of having well-defined error rates outweighs the loss of assessment of evidence that comes with their methods, but I don't think that that is very often the case. (And I would suspect that few proponents of the methods really understand the complete loss of evidential consideration of the data that they entail.) Fisher was adamant that the Neyman-Pearson approach to testing had no place in a scientific program, but he did allow that they were appropriate in the situation of 'industrial acceptance testing'. Presumably such a setting is a situation where rejection of a point hypothesis can be useful.</p>

<p>Most of science is more accurately modelled as estimation than as an acceptance procedure. P-values and the likelihood functions that they index (or, to use your term, address) provide very useful information for estimation, and for inferences based on that estimation.</p>

<p>(A couple of old StackExchange questions and answerd are relevant: <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/16218/what-is-the-difference-between-testing-of-hypothesis-and-test-of-significance/16227#16227"">What is the difference between &quot;testing of hypothesis&quot; and &quot;test of significance&quot;?</a> and <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/46856/interpretation-of-p-value-in-hypothesis-testing/46858#46858"">Interpretation of p-value in hypothesis testing</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are you missing the point of rejection  of a hypothesis (of low a priori probability)?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know if you are missing much, but it is probably not a good idea to add prior probabilities into this mixture! Much of the argumentation around the ideas relating to hypothesis testing, significance testing and evidential evaluation come from entrenched positions. Such arguments are not very helpful. (You might have noticed how carefully I avoided bringing Bayesianism into my discussion in the paper, even though I wholeheartedly embrace it when there are reasonable prior probabilities to use. First we need to fix the P-value provide evidence, error rates do not issue.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Should scientists ignore results that fail to reach 'significance'?</li>
</ul>

<p>No, of course not. Using an arbitrary cutoff to claim significance, or to assume significance, publishability, repeatability or reality of a result is a bad idea in most situations. The results of scientific experiments should be interpreted in light of prior understanding, prior probabilities where available, theory, the weight of contrary and complementary evidence, replications, loss functions where appropriate and a myriad of other intangibles. Scientists should not hand over to insentient algorithms the responsibility for inference. However, to make full use of the evidence within their experimental results scientists will need to much better understand what the statistical analyses can and do provide. That is the purpose of the paper that you have explored. It will also be necessary that scientists make a more complete account of their acquisition of evidence and the evolution of their understanding than what is usually presented in papers, and they should provide what Abelson called a principled argument to support their inferences. Relying on P&lt;0.05 is the opposite of a principled argument.</p>

I think what you mean is that they are <em>sequential</em>, in that they happen one after another. </p>

<p>Since you have the pdf of each, what you want to calculate is the sum of the three random times: $T = T_A+T_B+T_C$. Depending on the exact form of your pdfs, you can try one of three approaches: </p>

<ol>
<li>Recognize the sum as being equal to a particular distribution (e.g., sum of normals is normal)</li>
<li>Simulate the sum using Monte Carlo simulation</li>
<li>Analytically calculate the distribution of the sum by either multiplying the<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_function_%28probability_theory%29"" rel=""nofollow"">characteristic functions</a> of each pdf and then back-transforming to a denstity, or by directly performing two <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#Definition"" rel=""nofollow"">convolutions</a>: $f_C*(f_A*f_B)$</li>
</ol>

<p>I would recommend method 2 if you have access to a monte carlo simulator or know R or Matlab or any other numerical package. 1 is also OK...3 is a real pain unless you are lucky to be using simple distributions...in which case you will likely find a solution as per 1.</p>

58959,594.0,2,,58957.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Your question is quite general (specific cases may offer shortcuts), so I'll limit myself to suggesting strategies. Typically such a question involves constructing appropriate limits on integrals and trying to evaluate them by some means. Usually there will be a bivariate integral where the limits in the inner integral involve the variable in the outer integral. Sometimes the hardest part is simply writing the correct limits down; the general case will involve ""min"" and ""max"" functions on a problem like this. </p>

<p>To make progress I strongly suggest you get into the habit of making diagrams of the region you're trying to integrate.</p>

<p>A couple of suggested strategies for approaching such a problem, by making slightly simpler problems you might see how to write integrals for. </p>

<p>One approach: Let $Z = Y-aX$ and work out the joint probability in terms of $X$ and $Z$. </p>

<p>Another approach: First, replace your $x$ and $y$ with $x_0$ and $y_0$ so I can use $x$ and $y$ as dummy variables in the integration. If $a\leq y_0/x_0\leq b$ then you have a region like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdNn1.png"" alt=""region""> </p>

<p>While you can actually write the integral by splitting it up into pieces (move a vertical line along the $x$-axis and split the integral where your line hits any 'corners' on the dark green region), you might otherwise evaluate it by working out the probability of being in the rectangle $0&lt;X&lt;x_0; 0&lt;Y&lt;y_0$ and then subtract the two triangles.</p>

<p>The other cases (the other arrangements of $x_0$ and $y_0$ relative to $a$ and $b$) might be worked out by drawing the relevant diagram in order to obtain the right limits on the integrals; in each case you'll do something similar, but sometimes you might not hit a corner.</p>

<p>Take 7 classes: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. There will be #A instances with label A in your data set. And of course, #A + #B + #C + #D + #E + #F + #G = X</p>

<p>The chance of encountering an instance with label A, i.e. the probability of class A, pA, equals #A/X.</p>

<p>Now, if you consider a random baseline system, this system will assign labels to instances according to these probabilities. Because labels are assigned according to probabilities, each time you let the system label the instances a different result will be produced. A majority system or your SVM-based system will produce the same result, no matter how often they are applied. With an infinite number of runs of the random baseline system, on average, the following will happen:</p>

<p>Given an instance with gold label A, this instance will be labelled pA times as A, pB times as B, etc. This means that we have a (fractional) true positive count equal to the probability pA. There are #A instances with gold label A, the total true positive count for label A becomes #A*pA. This can be done for each label. The total number of true positives, TP, becomes:</p>

<p>TP = #A*pA + #B*pB + #C*pC + #D*pD + #E*pE + #F*pF + #G*pG</p>

<p>And the average accuracy of this baseline system becomes acc = TP/X</p>

<p>acc = 1/X * (#A*pA + #B*pB + #C*pC + #D*pD + #E*pE + #F*pF + #G*pG)</p>

<p>If the X is distributed over the different terms, and using the definition of the probabilities, this becomes:</p>

<p>acc = pA*pA + pB*pB + pC*pC + pD*pD + pE*pE + pF*pF + pG*pG</p>

<p>which is the formula that you refer to.</p>

<hr>

<p>As noted before, for an SVM-based system or a majority system, the average accuracy is equal to the accuracy of a single run. Meaning that the accuracies of a single run can be compared with the outcome of the random baseline formula.</p>

<p>If your machine learner produces slightly different results with each run (because it contains an element of randomness), you should compute the average accuracy for an infinite number of runs. But this is the ideal situation, and it may be impossible to compute. In practice, differences will be probably very small and most people stick to comparing using the outcome of a single run.  </p>

<p>where, $p_{home}=\frac{won_{home}}{total_{home}}$ and $p_{away}=\frac{won_{away}}{total_{away}}$ - if you want you can write a tie as a half win or exclude the ties all together - then what you have is categorical variable $home$ which can take a value of $1$ or $0$: $1$ for home and $0$ for away and two dependent proportions. For this problem you can then use the McNemar test or the paired t-test if your sample is large enough (see here: <a href=""http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/whatstat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/whatstat</a>). </p>

<p><code>res=nls(p2[,2] ~ c+a*I(p2[,1]^2)*exp(b*p2[,1]),start=list(a=0.1,b=-0.02,c=5))</code></p>

<p>Could anybody give any clear suggestion how to choose starting points for all the people I consider?

this code

<p>No, because the simple way of multiplying the coefficient by 100 and then interpreting as a factorial change only works when both the coefficient and the change in the independent variable are relatively small.</p>

<p>Consider the equation:</p>

<p>With one percent point increase:</p>

<p>$\ln(y') = \alpha + 1.5(X_1+0.01) + 0.8 X_2$</p>

<p>Subtracting for the difference:</p>

<p>$\ln(y') - \ln(y) = 1.5 \times 0.01$</p>

<p>$\ln(y'/y) = 0.015$</p>

<p>The factorial change is then:</p>

<p>$y'/y = 1.015113$,</p>

<p>which is about 1.5%. So, that approximation shortcut works.</p>

<hr>

<p>When the change is large, like your 0.299, the approximation can deviate:</p>

<p>$\ln(y'/y) = 1.5 \times 0.299$</p>

<p>In the classical non-bayesian context (the fact that your are learning about bias, and your working example, suggest that this is your context) the parameter $\theta$ is ... a parameter, a number; which is perhaps unknown to us but which takes nonetheless some determined fixed value. In short: $\theta$ <strong>is not a random variable</strong>.</p>

<p>The estimator, instead, is (in general) a random variable. Because $\hat{\theta}=g(\{X\})$ where $g(\cdot)$ is some function and $\{X\}$ is a list of realizations ($X_1,X_2 \cdots.. X_n$) of a random variable. (Think for example, of the sample average $(X_1+X_2+\cdots + X_n)/n$) This is to say: in different ""experiments"" (trials) we'll get different values of the estimator $\hat{\theta}$ . But in all experiments the parameter $\theta$ will be the same.</p>

<p>That's why it makes sense to ask if $E(\hat{\theta})=\theta$ (because the left side is the expectation of a random variable, the right side is a constant). And, if the equation is valid (it might or not be, according to the estimator) the estimator is unbiased.</p>

<p>In your example, you're using $\hat{\theta} = \frac{X_1+X_2+ \cdots + X_n}{n}\frac{4}{3}$. The expectation of this is $E(\hat{\theta} )= \frac{n E(X)}{n} \frac{4}{3}$
Now, we need to compute $E(X)$ (it will be a function of $\theta$) and check if that gives $\theta$.</p>

<p>If the samples were from quite different populations, you would have to take all the samples seriously. Otherwise one possible conclusion is that the sample of <span class=""math-container"">$n = 100$</span> is far too small to take seriously compared with the other samples.</p>

58992,13165.0,1,,,,Fixed point iterations for expectation propagation using energy minimization,<bayesian><inference><graphical-model>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p><strong>EP Primal</strong>  </p>

<p>In <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/papers/ep/minka-ep-energy.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">1</a>, it is finding the EP iterations by solving a saddle-point problem on the energy function. First, the primal is claimed to be 
$$
\min_{\hat{p}_i} \max_{q} \left[  \sum_i \int_{\mathbf{y}} \hat{p}_i(\mathbf{y}) \log \frac{  \hat{p}_i(\mathbf{y})  }{ t_i(\mathbf{y})  p(\mathbf{y})  }  d\mathbf{y}‎ - ‎(n-1) \int_\mathbf{y} q_\theta(\mathbf{y})  \log \frac{q_\theta(\mathbf{y})}{p(\mathbf{y})}  d\mathbf{y} \right]‎  
$$
‎with the  local moment matching constraints 
$$
‎\mathbb{E}_{ q_\theta(\mathbf{y}) }\left[ \phi(\mathbf{y})  \right] = \mathbb{E}_{  \hat{p}_i(\mathbf{y} )  }\left[ \phi(\mathbf{y})   \right]‎, ‎\forall i  \quad \quad  ‎$$</p>

<p><strong>EP Dual</strong></p>

<p>The dual energy function is the following; 
$$
‎\min_{\nu} \max_{\lambda} \left[  (n-1) \log \int_\mathbf{y}  p(\mathbf{y})  \exp \left( \nu^\top \phi(\mathbf{y}) \right) d\mathbf{y}‎ - ‎\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log  \int_\mathbf{y} \hat{t}_i(\mathbf{y}) p(\mathbf{y}) \exp \left( {\lambda_i}^\top  \phi (\mathbf{y}) \right) d\mathbf{y}   \right]‎,
$$
$$
‎(n-1) \nu = \sum_i \lambda_i‎.
$$</p>

<p><strong>EP fixed point iterations</strong></p>

<p>And using the dual energy function, we should be able to find the fixed point iterations: </p>

<p><em>Message elimination</em>: Choose a $\tilde{t}_i$  to do approximation with‎. ‎</p>

<p>‎Remove the factor $\tilde{t}_i$ from approximation‎, ‎$\; q_\theta^{-i} = \displaystyle \frac{q_\theta}{ \tilde{t}_i }$ 
‎
<em>Belief projection:</em> Project the approximate posterior‎, ‎with $\tilde{t}_i$ replaced with $t_i$‎, ‎on the approximating family‎,
‎$$‎
‎q^{new}_\theta(\mathbf{y}) = \text{proj}\left( \hat{p}_i(\mathbf{y}) \rightarrow q_\theta(\mathbf{y}) \right)‎,
‎$$‎
‎where‎, 
‎$$‎
‎\hat{p}_i(\mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{Z} q_\theta^{-i}(\mathbf{y}) t_i(\mathbf{y})‎,     ‎\; \;  Z = \int q_\theta^{-i}(\mathbf{y}) \times t_i(\mathbf{y}) d\mathbf{y}‎
‎$$‎</p>

<p>$‎
\tilde{t}_i = \arg \min_{\tilde{t}_i} \text{KL} \left( \displaystyle \frac{ t_i \prod_{j\neq i}  \tilde{t}_j  }{ \int t_i \prod_{j \neq i} \tilde{t}_j  } \parallel  q_\theta(\mathbf{y})  \right) 
$.  ‎</p>

<p>Message update: Compute the new approximating factor‎, 
‎$$‎
‎\tilde{t}_i  = Z \frac{ q^{new}_\theta(\mathbf{y}) }{  q_\theta^{-i}(\mathbf{y})‎ }
‎$$‎</p>

<p>Here are the questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>I know how how to derive dual from primal, but it it not clear to me where the primal is coming from. </li>
<li>I don't see how can I find the EP iterations from Dual. Any idea?  </li>

58993,17573.0,2,,58977.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Non-linear least squares solves $min_\beta \sum (y_i-f(x_i;\beta))^2$.  This is quadratic in $\beta$ if $f$ is linear in $\beta$.  Your $f$ is not linear in $\beta$, so the NLS objective function is not quadratic in $\beta$.  Of course, you don't need the function to be quadratic to guarantee convergence to a unique minimum, rather you need $min_\beta \sum (y_i-f(x_i;\beta))^2$ to be convex in $\beta$.  Presumably, with your $f$, the NLS objective function is not convex.  It doesn't look, to me, like the kind of $f$ which generates a convex objective function.  That's pretty much the explanation.  You can have lots of minima or one minimum.</p>

<p>If I were fitting the function that you are, I would use an entirely different approach.  I would not just blindly use NLS.  If you look carefully at your function, $f(x_i;\beta)=a*x_i^2exp(-bx_i)+c$ it is <em>almost</em> linear in the parameters.  If you fixed $b$ at some value, say 0.1, then you could fit $a$ and $c$ by OLS:
\begin{align}
y_i &amp;= a*x_i^2exp(-0.1x_i)+c \\
    &amp;= a*z_i+c
\end{align}
The variable $z_i$ is defined $z_i=x_i^2exp(-0.1x_i)$.  This means that, once you have picked $b$, the optimal value of $a=\widehat{Cov}(y,z)/\hat{V}(z)$ and the optimal value of $c=\overline{y}-a*\overline{z}$.</p>

<p>So what, right?  At the very least, this is how you should pick starting values for $a$ and $c$.  But, really, this reduces the search for optimal parameters to a one dimensional search over $b$.  With a modern computer, one dimensional searches are fast and easy.  If you have some idea of what reasonable values for $b$ are, then you can just define an interval $[b_{low},b_{high}]$ and grid search for the b which gives the lowest sum of squared errors.  Then use that $b$ and its associated optimal $a$ and $c$ to start NLS from.</p>

<p>Or, you could do something more sophisticated.  Suppose you are searching over $b$, using the optimal $a(b)$ and $c(b)$ from OLS.  Then the NLS objective function is $\sum \left(y_i - f(x_i;a(b),b,c(b))\right)^2$.  The envelope theorem makes the derivative of this very easy to calculate: 
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{d b} \sum \left(y_i - f(x_i;\beta)\right)^2 &amp;= \sum 2\left(y_i - f(x_i;\beta)\right)\frac{d}{d b}f(x_i;\beta)\\
&amp;= \sum 2\left(y_i - f(x_i;\beta)\right)(-abx_i^2exp(-bx_i))
\end{align}</p>

<p>So, you can easily write a function to calculate the NLS objective function for any given $b$ and you can easily write a function to calculate the derivative of the NLS objective function for any $b$.  These two ingredients are enough to get a optimizer going on your function.  Then, after you find the optimal $b$, just run NLS with that $b$ and its associated optimal $a$ and $c$.  It will converge in one iteration.</p>

<p>My problem is different.  Say I'm reading a paper describing a male vs female, disease vs control experiment, and I know the n's, means, and standard deviations for all four groups (healthy females, ... , diseased males), but I don't have the original data.</p>

Three drug treatments $D_1$, $D_2$ and $D_3$ were tested across three groups $G_1$, $G_2$ and $G_3$. For each group and treatment combination $D_i, G_k$ the data are exposure (no of patients being treated with drug) and effect (ratio of no of patients recovered from treatment to treated).<br>
I have to find a ordered list of treatments according to their effectiveness.</p>

<p>It requires combining the data taken from different groups. I know about Simpson's paradox and from the Bayesian belief networks (establishing the causal relationships) I know that groups (confounding or lurking variable) affect the exposure of the treatment and the effectiveness of the treatment, so I should use the partitioned data across different groups to come to any inference. The one way that I came across to remove this paradox is to break one of the relationships between the confounding variable and exposure or confounding variable and effectiveness. The relationship between the confounding variable and exposure could be broken if the exposure is same across groups or is proportional and that could be achieved through scaling exposure and effectiveness (multiplying by a factor that balances out the exposure across different groups). This works fine if I have all the data for each treatment, group combination.</p>

<p>But the data I have has some missing values: for a few $D_i, G_k$ I don't have their exposure and effectiveness. Should I use expectation maximization techniques here to find out the missing values and then use scaling while combining data? If I could how should I proceed to avoid getting spurious results?</p>

<p>The one assumption from the domain knowledge could be made that I could make here is that the groups should affect the effectiveness of every treatment the same way and the effect should be multiplicative,  </p>

<p>i.e. effect of drug for a group $D_i, G_k$ = effect of drug $D_i \times$ effect on group $G_k$ </p>

<p>The ambiguity lies in  how our friend peeking at the dice decides to report the information back to us. If we let $X_1$ and $X_2$ denote the random variables associated with the values of each of the dice, then it is certainly true that for each $k \in \{1,2,\ldots,6\}$,

<p>Formally, we need to properly define a random variable, say $K$, that encodes the knowledge imparted by our peeking friend.</p>

<p>Our peeking friend could always report the value of the left-most die, or the right-most, or the larger of the two. She could flip a coin and then report based on the coin flip, or employ any number of more complicated machinations.</p>

<p>But, once this process is specified, the apparent paradox vanishes.</p>

<p>Indeed, suppose that $K = X_1$. Then, we have
$$

<p>In the biomedical field boostrap resampling has thus become the standard. This is implemented in Harrell's rms package and so fairly easy to implement.

<p>It is worth mention that the benefit of the rms package is that it easily enables you to include some of the variable selection in the bootstap (built in stepwise selection option). This can be awkward to achieve with most commercial packages. </p>

<p>I own sense is that the differences have been overemphasized. I usually get pretty reliable/consistent results irrespective of the method used. With large sample sizes the differences are really non-existent. </p>

<p>Bootstrap validation - as well as the other resampling methods - can also easily be done wrong.

I then count how many times (out of 100 simulations) the binomial p-value &lt; 0.05.

<p>$$\varepsilon_t=y_t+\theta\varepsilon_{t-1}$$</p>

<p>So the error term for $t=1$ is,
$$\varepsilon_{1}=y_{1}+\theta\varepsilon_{0}$$
Now we cannot compute this without knowing the value of $\theta$. So to obtain this, we need to compute the Initial or Preliminary estimate of the model, refer to Box et al. of the said book, <strong>Section 6.3.2 page 202</strong> state that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has been shown that the first $q$ autocorrelations of MA($q$) process
  are nonzero and can be written in terms of the parameters of the model
  as
  $$\rho_k=\displaystyle\frac{-\theta_{k}+\theta_1\theta_{k+1}+\theta_2\theta_{k+2}+\cdots+\theta_{q-k}\theta_q}{1+\theta_1^2+\theta_2^2+\cdots+\theta_q^2}\quad k=1,2,\cdots, q$$ The expression above for$\rho_1,\rho_2\cdots,\rho_q$
  in terms $\theta_1,\theta_2,\cdots,\theta_q$, supplies $q$ equations
  in $q$ unknowns. Preliminary estimates of the $\theta$s can be
  obtained by substituting estimates $r_k$ for $\rho_k$ in above
  equation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that $r_k$ is the estimated autocorrelation. There are more discussion in <strong>Section 6.3 - Initial Estimates for the Parameters</strong>, please read on that. Now, assuming we obtain the initial estimate $\theta=0.5$. Then,
$$\varepsilon_{1}=y_{1}+0.5\varepsilon_{0}$$
Now, another problem is we don't have value for $\varepsilon_0$ because $t$ starts at 1, and so we cannot compute $\varepsilon_1$. Luckily, there are two methods two obtain this,</p>

<ol>
<li>Conditional Likelihood</li>
<li>Unconditional Likelihood</li>
</ol>

<p>According to Box et al. <strong>Section 7.1.3 page 227</strong>, the values of $\varepsilon_0$ can be substituted to zero as an approximation if $n$ is moderate or large, this method is Conditional Likelihood. Otherwise, Unconditional Likelihood is used, wherein the value of $\varepsilon_0$ is obtain by back-forecasting, Box et al. recommend this method. Read more about back-forecasting at <strong>Section 7.1.4 page 231</strong>. </p>

<p>After obtaining the initial estimates and value of $\varepsilon_0$, then finally we can proceed with the recursive calculation of the error term. Then the final stage is to estimate the parameter of the model $(1)$, remember this is not the preliminary estimate anymore.</p>

<p>In estimating the parameter $\theta$, I use Nonlinear Estimation procedure, particularly the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, since MA models are nonlinear on its parameter.</p>

For instance, to check serial autocorrelation in the residuals, Wald tests for coefficients and for time dummies and the Sargan test to evaluate if there is correlation between the instrumental variable and the residuals. Then I performed a Wald test (the first one in <a href=""http://www.fnu.zmaw.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/publication/working-papers/FNU47.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Erdil &amp; Yetkiner, 2004</a>) with the sum of squared residuals of an unrestricted model (<em>SSRu</em>) and of a restricted model (<em>SSRr</em>).

<p>1) Do the time dummies remove the time effect?  I think so.</p>

<p>1.1) What if the time dummies aren't significant?</p>

<p>2) Therefore, if I got rid of the individuals and time effects, is the Wald test (<em>SSRr-SSRu</em>) be as a Wald test applied to an <code>OLS</code> model? I think so.
If so, I’m not sure about the freedom degrees. Let’s see first the test suggested by Erdil &amp; Yetkiner (2004):</p>

<p>$$W=\frac{(SSRr-SSRu)/Np}{SSRu/[NT-N(1+p)-p]}$$</p>

<p>where <em>N</em>= number of individuals, <em>T</em>=years and <em>p</em>=number of lags. Note that they didn’t get rid of individuals and time effects (at least that's what I understood).
Now, if I got rid of individuals and time effects the Wald test as applied to OLS models would be:
 $$W=\frac{(SSRr-SSRu)/m}{SSRu/ (n-k)}$$ where <em>m</em>= number of restrictions (number of coefficients that were removed from the unrestricted model to turn it restricted), <em>k</em>= total number of coefficients in the unrestricted model and <em>n</em>= number of observation.</p>

<p>More questions:</p>

<p>3) What is number of observation?</p>

<p>3.1) Is it the number of year or number of years*number of individuals? If it is number of years it seems reasonable, but if it is the product between years and individual it doesn’t. For example, in my case I have 328 individual and 13 years, so it is 4264; therefore, the numerator in the Wald test will be very, very small and I’ll be rejecting everything.</p>

<p>Finally, </p>

<p>4) Am I right doing as I did?</p>

<p>Again, any help will be much appreciated </p>

59041,594.0,2,,59029.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I have a number of additional comments to make regarding issues I have with what you're describing (which I will come back to), but first let's just deal with the simple question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would now like to calculate the significance of observing at least 4 p-values &lt; 0.05 in six experiments total.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By 'significance' I assume you mean 'probability of ... under the null'.</p>

<p><em>Simple version</em>:</p>

<p>Imagine that the sample sizes were such that we could treat the distribution of p-values under the null as continuous. In that case they will be uniform under the null.</p>

<p>Then under $H_0$ each experiment has a 5% chance of giving a p-value below 0.05</p>

<p>The distribution of the number of experiments yielding p-values below 0.05 under the null is $\text{binomial}(6,0.05)$</p>

<p>Let $X\sim \text{binomial}(6,0.05)$. Then $P(X\geq 4) = 8.64\times 10^{-5}$</p>

<p><em>Less simple version</em>:</p>

<p>The distribution of p-values is discrete, and a significance level of exactly 0.05 won't typically be attainable. A more accurate answer in this case involves finding the largest possible p-value less than 0.05 (which depends on the exact sample size for each experiment), and then doing a similar calculation for that case. It will give a smaller probability than the one I just calculated. This involves some slightly more complicated calculation, but it's perfectly possible to do it exactly, without simulation. </p>

<p>(I don't think your simulation approach looks right, by the way, but since it's possible to do this question without worrying about that, I won't labor the point.)</p>

<p>Depending on the research interests, this method can be extremely powerful.</p>

<p>As someone has already said before, if you are merely interested in estimating the marginal mean (or any quantile) of your outcome then you don't need to worry about any assumption at all, as both quantile and ordinary regression methods perfectly estimate it.</p>

<p>If you are interested in inference, ordinary regression has a couple of problems with the distribution assumptions, whereas the quantile doesn't because it is distribution free.
It's true that you can try using mean regression and robust estimators, but personally I prefer quantile regression, which is by the way even more informative (because you can estimate the whole conditional distribution of the outcome instead of just one of its summary indicators, the mean).</p>

<p>If you are interested in both prediction and inference, then the quantile's property of invariance is quite handy.
For example, suppose you are working with probabilities, or rates (or any other ""bounded"" outcome).
With quantile regression you can transform the outcome Y so that it's transformation is not bounded (for example, using a logit or probit function), model logit(Y) and use the same model for predictions and inference.</p>

<p>With ordinary methods it's not so easy, because of Jensen's inequality: E(g(Y)) is never equal to g(E(Y)).</p>

<p>Therefore, you either use two models (one for the prediction, one for the association) or you must use other methods (beta regression, logit normal regression) that, however, have problems related to respectively parameter interpretation and distribution assumptions.</p>

<p>Finally, there can always be problems related to the linearity assumption or independent data. In the former, we can solve the problem by adding splines (which, though, complicate the interpretation of parameters).</p>

<p>For the latter, instead, mixed effect regression models could help us (if we have hierarchical or longitudinal data).</p>

Thus my question regarding the utility of the standard deviation of the mean difference.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm lacking in statistical knowledge and please feel free to point out a suitable reference for me to consult.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Update - example:</strong><br>
<em>Machine A</em> is the reference measurement system. <em>Machine B</em> is the new measurement system. A certain number of real life measurements are made with each machine (<em>N</em>) on a common object to understand how equivalent the machines are. Ideally they're identical - ""of course"" say the designers, and can even be expected - but this testing will be used to support the equivalence limit of +/- <em>x</em> units. (Given in reality it's not possible to say <em>A</em> is exactly equivalent to <em>B</em>.) So a paired measurement comparison.</p>

<p>When reporting these results it has been common to report the mean difference and the standard deviation of the mean difference, plus the correlation coefficient (Pearson's) with its p value.</p>

<p><strong>Update - comments:</strong><br>
1. This question does indeed refer to the standard deviation of the mean difference, not simply the difference.<br>
2. I well understand what the standard deviation means in terms of distributions. But my question is really ""what is the meaning of the standard deviation of the mean difference in relation to the quantity being measured?""<br>
3. If it's as simple as a guide to the variability of the difference, then so be it.<br>
4. If the result was reported as A = B +/- <em>x</em> units with a p &lt; 0.05 then I understand that this is different to quoting a standard deviation type number, but I still get it intuitively. I don't get the SD of a MD in regard to the original measurement entity nearly as well.</p>

59096,594.0,2,,59088.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Let's see what Dan Ma actually says in his blog. To quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is uncertainty in the parameter $\theta$, reflecting the risk characteristic of the insured. Some insureds are poor risks (with large $\theta$) and some are good risks (with small $\theta$). Thus the parameter $\theta$ should be regarded as a random variable $\Theta$. The following is the conditional distribution of $N$ (conditional on $\Theta=\theta$):</p>
  
  <p>$$\displaystyle (15) \ \ \ \ \ P(N=n \lvert \Theta=\theta)=\frac{e^{-\theta} \ \theta^n}{n!} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n=0,1,2,\cdots$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from some small oddness in the wording, the gist of that is fine. The parameter of the Poisson ($\theta$ in the quoted discussion) represents the underlying rate of claims per unit time; that individuals are homogeneous, and have different 'riskiness' (different claim-rates) isn't controversial.</p>

<p>So why does he think that the distribution of the claim-rate is distributed as gamma? </p>

<p>Well, actually he doesn't say that he thinks that at all. </p>

<p>What he says is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that $\Theta$ has a Gamma distribution with scale parameter $\alpha$ and shape parameter $\beta$. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He's positing a circumstance -- discussing an assumption if you wish -- for which he then discusses the consequences. </p>

<p>He doesn't even assert anything about the plausibility of the assumption.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's some things that might be reasonable to assert/suppose about the claim-rate distribution:</p>

<p>1) It's necessarily non-negative and may be taken to be continuous</p>

<p>2) we could expect that it would tend to be right-skew </p>

<p>3) We might not-too-unreasonably expect there to be a typical level (a mode), around which the bulk of the distribution lies, and that it tails off as we move further away (i.e. it might be reasonable to expect that it would be unimodal, at least to a first approximation)</p>

<p>That's about all we could say without collecting data. </p>

<p>The gamma at least doesn't break any of those suppositions/expectations, and so is likely to result in a more useful distribution than assuming homogeneity of claim-rate, but any number of other distributions satisfy those conditions. </p>

<p>So why gamma rather than lognormal say? Likely, a matter of convenience; the gamma works nicely with the Poisson - which even conditional on the individual underlying claim-frequency is itself another assumption that isn't actually true (though we can make some argument that the assumptions of claims having a Poisson process may not be too badly wrong, it's clear that they can't be exactly true).</p>

<p>There's no good reason to think it <em>is</em> gamma-distributed. </p>

<p>Indeed, I'll assert here and now that there's no real-world case where the claim rate <em>is</em> actually gamma distributed, in practice there will always be differences between the actual distribution of interest and some simple model for it; but that's true of essentially all our probability models. </p>

<p>They're <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/730/805"">convenient fictions</a>, which may sometimes be not so badly inaccurate as to have some value. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a way I can determine if my density is gamma distributed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing will tell you it <em>is</em>; in fact you can be quite sure - even when it looks like an excellent description of the distribution - that the gamma is at best merely an approximation. You can use diagnostic displays (perhaps something like a Q-Q plot) to help check that it's not too far from gamma.</p>

I would like to know if the two DVs are correlated or not.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what the data look like, e.g. a data frame in R:</p>

<pre><code># Make some data:
set.seed(1154)

data &lt;- data.frame(id=gl(10, 6),
                   factor1=gl(2, 3, labels=c(""A"", ""B"")),

                   DV2=rnorm(60))

head(data)

# Output:
#   id factor1 factor2          DV1         DV2
# 1  1       A       1  0.255579320  1.72318604
# 2  1       A       2  0.133878731 -0.32694875
# 3  1       A       3  0.890576655  0.14834580

# 6  1       B       3  0.701357069 -0.50813556
</code></pre>

<p>In R, I could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>cor.test(data$DV1, data$DV2) # p = 0.048, significant
</code></pre>

<p>but there seem to be two problems with that.</p>

<p>First problem: the data are not independent (first 6 items from each DV come from the same participant in the experiment).</p>

<p>Second problem: we want to generalize from a sample to the population, so each id in the sample should just be included only once, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code># We want:
#  id  factor1  factor2  DV1  DV2
#  1      X        X     ...  ...
#  2      X        X     ...
#  3   ...

# So:
library(plyr)
data2 &lt;- ddply(data, .(id), summarize, mean.DV1=mean(DV1), mean.DV2=mean(DV2))
head(data2)

# Output:
#   id    mean.DV1    mean.DV2
# 1  1  0.49163739  0.09302105
# 2  2  0.66030997 -0.09344809
# 3  3  0.38277688  0.20274906
# 4  4 -0.35217913  0.57308528
# 5  5 -0.13470820  0.26663012
# 6  6 -0.04756911  0.60406950
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can look for a correlation and the responses are independent, but I have lost the individual factor levels.</p>

<pre><code>cor.test(data2$mean.DV1, data2$mean.DV2) # p = .15, not significant

59065,2666.0,2,,59058.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I don't prefer to think of this type of a problem as a ""choose between two transformations"" problem but rather I like to estimate the transformation as part of the modeling process.  In doing so we take care of multiplicities (possible inflated type I error) by having a parameter in the model for everything we think <em>might</em> be needed.  Consider expanding the predictor using a regression spline such as a restricted cubic spline (natural spline).  Test for association by doing a ""chunk"" test of all the parameters jointly that involve that predictor.  With a restricted cubic spline this test will have $k-1$ degrees of freedom where $k$ is the number of knots (join points), and using defaults for knots based on the marginal distribution of the predictor will work fine (this is how the R <code>rms</code> package's <code>rcs</code> function does it).  </p>

<p>Once you fit the spline model you can plot the predicted value vs. the predictor to learn about the estimated shape in the logistic model.</p>

<p>Concerning $Y$ make sure that it is truly all-or-nothing and does not represent a dichotomization.</p>

59067,11489.0,2,,59061.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Think of the difference like any other statistic that you are collecting. These differences are just some values that you have recorded. You calculate their mean and standard deviation to understand how they are spread (for example, in relation to 0) in a unit-independent fashion. </p>

<p>The usefulness of the SD is in its popularity -- if you tell me your mean and SD, I have a better understanding of the data than if you tell me the results of a TOST that I would have to look up first.</p>

<p>Also, I'm not sure how the difference and its SD relate to a correlation coefficient (I assume that you refer to the correlation between two variables for which you also calculate the pairwise differences). These are two very different things. You can have no correlation but a significant MD, or vice versa, or both, or none.</p>

<p>By the way, do you mean the standard deviation of the mean difference or standard deviation of the difference?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>OK, so what is the difference between SD of the difference and SD of the mean?</p>

<p>The former tells you something about how the measurements are spread; it is an estimator of the SD in the population. That is, when you do a single measurement in A and in B, how much will the difference A-B vary around its mean?</p>

<p>The latter tells us something about how well you were able to estimate the mean difference between the machines. This is why ""standard difference of the mean"" is sometimes referred to as ""standard error of the mean"". It depends on how many measurements you have performed: Since you divide by $\sqrt{n}$, the more measurements you have, the smaller the value of the SD of the mean difference will be.</p>

<p>SD of the difference will answer the question ""how much does the discrepancy between A and B vary (in reality) between measurements""?</p>

<p>SD of the mean difference will answer the question ""how confident are you about the mean difference you have measured""? (Then again, I think confidence intervals would be more appropriate.)</p>

<p>So depending on the context of your work, the latter might be more relevant for the reader. ""Oh"" - so the reviewer thinks - ""they found that the difference between A and B is x. Are they sure about that? What is the SD of the mean difference?""</p>

<p>There is also a second reason to include this value. You see, if reporting a certain statistic in a certain field is common, it is a dumb thing to <em>not</em> report it, because not reporting it raises questions in the reviewer's mind whether you are not hiding something. But you are free to comment on the usefulness of this value.</p>

<p>There is good reason to reduce collinear variables when clustering.</p>

<p><strong>Curse of Dimensionality</strong></p>

<p>The more dimensions you use, the more likely you are to fall victim of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality"" rel=""nofollow"">Bellman's 'curse of dimensionality'</a>.  In brief, the greater the number of dimensions, the greater the total volume, and the greater the sparsity of your data within it.  (See the link for more detail.)</p>

<p><strong>Dimension Reduction --- manually by inspecting of pairwise collinearity...</strong></p>

<p>You mention that you have already reduced variables from some larger number down to 5 using pairwise collinearity measures.</p>

<p>While this will work, it is quite tedious, since in general you will have $n\choose 2$ number of pairs to check.  (So for example with 10 variables, you would have ${10 \choose 2} = 45$ different pairs to examine -- a few too many to do manually in my opinion!</p>

<p><strong>Dimension Reduction --- automatically using Principal Components Analysis (PCA)...</strong></p>

<p>One way to handle this automatically is to use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">PCA (principle components analysis) algorithm</a>.  The concept is more or less what you're doing manually -- ranking the variables by how much unique information each variable is contributing.</p>

<p>So you provide PCA your $n$-variable dataset as input, and PCA will rank order your variables according to the greatest variance each explains in the data -- essentially picking out the non-collinear variables.  </p>

<p>Depending on whether you want 2-D or 3-D clusters, you would use the top 2 or 3 variables from PCA.</p>

<p><strong>Principal Components in R</strong></p>

<p>The PCA algorithm is available (built-in) from R.  </p>

<p>My second question, I found out I can use ICC and Bland &amp; Altman to analyse the intra-rater reliability. Are these two suitable or are there other statistical methods? 
The kappa statistic seems not very suitable since I have 31 raters, each rating 4 subjects. Or is there a way to deal with the kappa statistic and such a big database?</p>

<p>My third question is, which ICC can I use for the ratio data to calculate the intra-rater reliabiliy? I read different suggestions in the literature (ICC 1.1 or ICC 3.1)</p>

<p>My fourth question is, if I use Bland &amp; Altman the first thing I need to do is calculating the mean of time 1 and time 2. Do I need to do this for each item, each subject and each rater independently or can I calculate the mean for each item on each subject for all raters together? 
Or wouldn't it make sense to calculate this for the raters together, because the mean on both times can be the same, without have agreement (for example rater 1 scores less on time 2 and rater 2 scores higher on time 2, keeping the mean the same on both time 1 and time 2)</p>

<p><code>Y</code> is the probability of an outcome that takes on binary values (0,1).
<code>Z</code> is a continuous variable; I am trying to determine if it is significant
Number of positive and negative scores take on integer values between (0,5)</p>

<p>When I run the regression using <code>glm</code> in <code>matlab</code>, I find that all coefficients are significant except for b3; b1 and b4 are positive whereas b2 and b5 are negative. I would like to draw conclusions about whether Z is in fact a significant factor in the outcome variable via interactions b4 and b5, but I understand that in a logistic regression all coefficients and particularly interactions need to be evaluated in the context of specific values of the independent variable x. So this is what I have done so far:</p>

<p>Let's say bhat is the estimated vector of coefficients <code>b=(a1,b1,b2,b3,b4,b5...)</code> and <code>xhat</code> is the sample mean of <code>x=(num pos scores, num neg scores,Z,Z*num pos scores, Z*num neg scores)</code>. Also say that bi_sigma is the estimated standard error on the ith element of bhat and <code>xi_sigma</code> is the sample standard deviation of the ith element of x. Let's say <code>L(bx)</code> is the logistic cdf evaluated at bx.</p>

<p>Am I right to evaluate the odds ratios <code>exp(bhat*xhat-bi_sigma*xi_hat)</code> and <code>exp(bhat*xhat+bi_sigma*xi_hat)</code>, then determine whether each element bi_hat is significant based on whether the range of these odds ratios is strictly greater than or less than one? In other words, my thinking is that if the odds ratios don't include one then they significantly improve or decrease the odds. For instance an odds ratio range of (1.3,2) reflects a bi that improves the odds for mean levels of x. Yes?</p>

<p>Secondly, am I correct to evaluate the first differences, <code>L(bhat*xhat)-L(bhat*xhat-bi*xi_sigma)</code> and <code>L(bhat*xhat+bi*xi_sigma)-L(b*xhat)</code> as two measures of the size of the impact of each <code>xi</code>. Can I do this for the interaction also?</p>

<p>If it helps I am trying to use the framework proposed by Richard Royall:</p>

<p>1) The likelihood function tells me ""how to interpret this body of observations as evidence""</p>

<p>While the priors used here are subjective/nebulous they are built out of simple building blocks (uniform and normal distributions) that mathematically unsophisticated researchers can understand quickly. I think they convey my thought processes as a researcher well. Others may of course know of different background information. They should be able to build their own ""compound prior"" which may lead to a different decision than mine, but we should always agree on the likelihood function.</p>

<p>This approach (if implemented correctly, which I am not sure I am doing here), appears to me to model the actual thought processes of researchers and thus be suitable for scientific inference. The steps map to the common sections found in scientific papers. The priors are the introduction, the likelihood is the results, and the posterior probability is the discussion.</p>

<p>In short, no, a Cox proportional hazards model doesn't really give you back that information - the model itself doesn't calculate the underlying hazard, just the relative difference in the hazard between covariate values. This rather nicely <em>frees</em> you from having to specify the underlying hazard of your outcome, which in many cases is unknown, not particularly of interest in the first place, or difficult to specify using a parametric model.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> want to estimate the underlying hazard function, you need to use parametric survival models, such as those used in survreg. There are a large number of tutorials online, including code, for survreg and parametric models.</p>

<p>Assuming your general covariance is $K$ (here $K = \sigma^2 I$) the loglikehood $L$ is equal to :
$L = -\frac{N}{2}\log(2\pi) - \frac{1}{2} \log(|K|) - \frac{1}{2} (y-\hat{y})^T K^{-1}(y-\hat{y})$, where as I said above $N$ is your number of readings and now $\hat{y}$ are the model fitted values; $(y-\hat{y})$ are your model's residuals and $|K|$ denotes the determinant of the covariance matrix $K$.</p>

<p>I have three sets of 10 measurements. Each set corresponds to a different geographic region.
So in total I have 30 measurements of my variable, and I have the factor ""region"" with 3 levels (west region, middle region, east region).</p>

<p>Let's say I do a simple ANOVA and I get differences between the 3 regions. But I want to play a little with the possibility of this differences being ""by chance"".

<p>I want to know if it's possible to do the following (or if the idea is appropriate):</p>

<p>If there is really no difference between the 3 regions, then I can assume that any test (eg ANOVA or a non-parametric equivalent) will find approximate the same results even if I randomly mix all data once and again. So I thought I could simulate this, using my own data but just in different grouping. for example:
1- take all the 30 values from my own measurements
2- shuffle them into 3 groups, ie. randomly choose 10 values and assign them to a randomly chosen group; repeat with the next 10 data and then you have again 3 groups of 10 measurements.
3- run the test (eg. ANOVA)</p>

<p>Now I go back to 1, and repeat this eg 1000 times, and see if there is a convergence towards a ""stable"" pattern. If there is, then there are actually no differences.
If the convergence deviates a lot from the results I found with my ""real"" dataset, then I may think there are actually differences between the 3 regions.</p>

<p>This is the central insight that underlies resampling methods, such as permutation tests / randomization tests.</p>
<p>e.g. see Wikipedia, for example <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_%28statistics%29#Permutation_tests"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>
<p>The basic idea of a permutation test (let's take a one way ANOVA-like situation) is that if the null is true, the group labels are arbitrary - you don't change the distributions by shuffling them.</p>
<p>So if you look at all possible arrangements of the group labels and compute some test statistic of interest, you obtain what's called the permutation distribution of the test statistic. You can then see if your particular sample (which will be one of the possible permutations - or more accurately, possible combinations) is unusually far 'in the tails' of that null distribution (giving a p-values).</p>
<p>Many of the common nonparametric rank-based tests are actually permutation-tests carried out on the ranks (which is a practical way of doing permutation tests without computers, which are otherwise very tedious unless you have very small sample sizes).</p>
<p>When the sample sizes are large, an option is to sample (with replacement) from the permutation distribution, typically because there are too many combinations to evaluate them all. Generally this is achieved by randomly permuting the labels rather than systematically re-arranging them to cover every possibility. The test statistic is then computed for each such arrangement. The sample value of the statistic is then compared with the distribution (it is normally included as part of the distribution for computing the p-value, and counts in the values 'at least as extreme' as itself). Some authors call this sampled permutation test a randomization test (though other authors reserve that term for a somewhat different notion also connected to permutation tests).</p>
<p>What you described was pretty close to this randomly sampled permutation test (randomization test).</p>
<p>I advise trying such a randomization test, not least for its ability to expand your horizons in terms of the standard tools you have available for tackling problems. The procedure is distribution-free (conditional on the sample) - it requires fewer assumptions while still allowing you to use either familiar statistics or ones custom-designed to your circumstances (e.g. you could slot in a more robust measure of location).</p>
<p>In practice I'd advise more than 1000 resamples for a randomization test. Consider a test with a p-value near 5%. The standard error of an estimated p-value for a sample size of 1000 will be nearly 0.007; when the true p-value is just on one side of 5%, nearly 15% of the time you'll see a value more than 1% on the wrong side (more than 6% or less than 4% when it should be the other side). I usually regard 10000 as toward the low end of what I do unless I just want a rough idea of the ballpark of the p-value. If I was doing a formal test, I'd want to pin it down a bit better. I often do 100,000 and sometimes a million or more - at least for the simpler tests.</p>
<p>If you search here on <em>permutation tests</em> or <em>randomization tests</em> you should find a number of relevant questions and answers and even some examples.</p>

for some of the parameters I observed significant values in the two-way ANOVA for the main effect of Spectrum p&lt;.05, but none of the uncorrected multiple comparisons between the two spectra at all four LBs was significant (ok one was &lt;.1, but I'm testing against .05), which some people commented with ""impossible"".
Is this possible?</p>

<p>Then people said: ""ok paired t.tests should come up with the same results"" so I did this:</p>

<pre><code>df &lt;- anovaFrameWithGlareFoveal
df.led &lt;- subset(df, Spectrum == ""LED"")
df.hs &lt;- subset(df, Spectrum == ""HS"")
t.test(df.led$C_measured[df.led$LB==.1], df.hs$C_measured[df.hs$LB==.1], paired=T)
t.test(df.led$C_measured[df.led$LB==.21], df.hs$C_measured[df.hs$LB==.21], paired=T)
t.test(df.led$C_measured[df.led$LB==.3], df.hs$C_measured[df.hs$LB==.3], paired=T)
t.test(df.led$C_measured[df.led$LB==1], df.hs$C_measured[df.hs$LB==1], paired=T)
</code></pre>

<p>then all of the t.tests were significant (&lt;.05) but only one of the uncorrected multiple comparison was significant (&lt;.05).</p>

<p>I'm not really that much into statistics that I can definitively argue for or against one method or combined methods or whether the lme + glht alone is sufficient. Had a tough time on that the last week and am really curiously looking forward to your comments!</p>

<p>By sort of stable, I mean something like this which I mentioned in the comment later on to clarify my question.</p>

<p>Since A and C are inversely co-related, so if I choose power from A and C out of four locations, I would get some power all the time (always above 30 in this scenario). But if I take A and B, I would get very high amount of power when I have power (like 70+100=170 in hour 9), and I wont get any power at Hour 12 (since A and B produces 00 power in Hour 12).  I want to avoid choosing A and B, and I want to choose A and C.  My objective is to choose 10 locations out of 600 where by adding powers of each hour of 10 locations, total power for each hour should be above a certain threshold, like 30.</p>

<p>One possible modelling approach could be the following (for each individual separately): First, you have to decide on how you will partition the day in time zones (half-hours? Hours? Morning-Noon, etc? Depends on the particulars of your case). Given this partition, your data will be grouped in each time zone, for each day, as a count ""XX tweets during time zone 2"" etc.  </p>

$p_{it}=$ ""Tweet during time zone $i$ of day $t$"", $t=1,...,60$, since you say you have data for 60 days.</p>

<p>From here on you can do various things: check each time series for stability: do the pattern remains approximately the same? Here, how you have partitioned the day becomes crucial (the smaller the time interval represented in each time zone, the more instability is to be expected).  </p>

<p>If you expect to be getting more data as days pass, you can adopt a Bayesian, updating approach, estimate a prior distribution with these first 60 days of data, and then gradually update the estimation of the distribution as new data come in: the new estimate will give you the probabilities of when the persons will tweet the next day, for each time zone.</p>

<p>But also you can view all the time zones together as a Vector Autoregression (VAR), of $k-1$ equations (since probabilities add up to unity), and do what one can do with VAR's, i.e. model the tomorrow probability of each time zone, as depending in a usually linear way on the corresponding probabilities of previous days (lag length to be determined during by the data and the model specification process).</p>

These ambiguous choices are, for example, which case to be included, which case is categorized as outlier, running numerous model specification until something shows up, do not publish null results, etc. (The paper that sparked this debate in psychology is <a href=""http://people.psych.cornell.edu/~jec7/pcd%20pubs/simmonsetal11.pdf"">here</a>, see a popular Slate article and follow-up debate by Andrew Gelman <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/07/statistics_and_psychology_multiple_comparisons_give_spurious_results.html"">here</a>, and the Time magazine also touches on this topic <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble"">here</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, one clarification question:</p>

<p>The <em>Time</em> magazine wrote, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A power of 0.8 means that of ten true hypotheses tested, only two
  will be ruled out because their effects are not picked up in the
  data;""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure how this fits into the definition of the power function I found in textbook, which is the probability of rejecting the null as a function of parameter $\theta$. With different $\theta$ we have different power, so I don't quite understand the above quote.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, some research implications:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In my field of political science / economics, scholars simply use up all the country-year data available. Thus, should we not be concerned with sample fiddling here?</p></li>
<li><p>Can the problem of running multiple tests but reporting only one model be fixed simply by the fact that someone else in the discipline will re-test your paper and strike you down immediately for not having robust results? Anticipating this, scholars in my field are more likely to include a <code>robustness check</code> section, where they show that multiple model specifications does not change the result. Is this sufficient?</p></li>
<li><p>Andrew Gelman and others raise the point that no matter the data, it would be always possible to find and publish some ""pattern"" that isn't really there. But this should not be a concern, given the fact that any empirical ""pattern"" must be supported by a theory, and rival theories within a discipline will just engage in an debate / race to find which camp is able to find more ""patterns"" in various places. If a pattern is truly spurious, then the theory behind will be quickly struck down when there is no similar pattern in other samples / settings. Isn't this how science progresses?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that the current trend of journals for null result will actually flourish, is there a way for us to aggregate all the null and positive results together and make an inference on the theory that they all try to test?</p></li>

59126,5821.0,2,,59124.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>The field of statistical science has addressed these issues since its outset. I keep saying the role of the statistician is to ensure that the type 1 error rate remains fixed. This implies that the risk of making false positive conclusions cannot be eliminated, but can be controlled. This should draw our attention to the extremely large volume of scientific research that's being conducted rather than toward the philosophy and ethics of general statistical practice. For every incredible (uncredible) result that surfaces in the media (or in government policy) at least 19 other uncredible results were shot down for their null findings.</p>

<p>Indeed, if you go to, say, clinicaltrials.gov, you will observe there are (for almost any disease indication) well over 1,000 clinical trials for pharmaceutical agents going on in the US at this very moment. That means, that with a false positive error rate of 0.001, on average at least 1 drug will be put on the shelves that has no effect. The validity of 0.05 as a validated threshold for statistical significance has been challenged again and again. Ironically, it's only the statisticians who feel uncomfortable with using a 1/20 false positive error rate whereas financial stakeholders (be they PIs, or Merck) will pursue beliefs tenaciously regardless of in-vitro results, theoretical proofs, or strength of prior evidence. Honestly, that tenacity is a successful and laudable personal quality of many individuals who are successful in non-statistical roles. They are generally seated above statisticians, in their respective totems, who tend to leverage that tenacity.</p>

<p>I think the Time quote you put forward is completely wrong. Power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given it's false. This more importantly depends on exactly how ""false"" the null hypothesis is (which in turn depends on a measurable effect size). I rarely talk of power out of the context of the effect which we would deem ""interesting"" to detect. (for instance, a 4 month survival following chemotherapeutic treatment of stage 4 pancreatic cancer is not interesting, hence there's no reason to recruit 5,000 individuals for a phase 3 trial).</p>

<p>To address the questions you asked</p>

<ol>
<li><p>???</p></li>
<li><p>Multiplicity is difficult because it does not lead to an obvious decision rule about how to handle the data. For instance, suppose we are interested in a simple test of mean difference. Despite the infinite protestations of my colleagues, it is easy to show a t-test is well calibrated to detect differences in mean regardless of the sampling distribution of the data. Suppose we alternately pursued their path. They would begin by testing for normality using some variant of a well known distributional test (say calibration of the qqplot). If the data appeared sufficiently non-normal, they would then ask whether the data follow any well known transformation, and then apply a Box Cox transformation to determine a power transformation (possibly logarithmic) which maximizes entropy. If an obvious numerical value pops out, they will use that transformation. If not, they will use the ""distribution free"" Wilcoxon test. For this ad-hoc sequence of events, I cannot begin to hope how to calculate the calibration and power for a simple test of mean differences when the simple, stupid t-test would have sufficed. I suspect stupid acts like this can be linked mathematically to Hodge's superefficient estimation: estimators which are high power under a specific hypothesis we want to be true. Nonetheless, this process is <em>not</em> statistical because the false positive error rate has not been controlled.</p></li>
<li><p>The concept that trends can be ""discovered"" erroneously in any random set of data probably traces back to the well written article by Martin called <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18788144"" rel=""nofollow"">""Munchaesen's Statistical Grid""</a>. This is a very illuminating read and dates back to 1984 before the golden calf of machine learning was born unto us as we presently know it. Indeed, a correctly stated hypothesis is falsifiable, but type 1 errors have grown to be much more costly in our data driven society than they ever were before. Consider, for instance, the falsified evidence of the anti-vaccine research that has led to a massive sequence of pertussis deaths. The results which spurned the public defenestration of vaccines was linked a <em>a single study</em> (which, although wrong, was neither confirmed by external research). There is an ethical impetus to conduct results and report honest-to-goodness strength of evidence. How strong is evidence? It has little to do with the p-value you obtain, but the p-value you said you would call significant. And remember, fudging your data changes the value of p, even when the final confirmatory test reports something different (often much smaller).</p></li>
<li><p>YES! You can clearly see in meta-analyses published by journals such as the Cochrane report that the distribution of test results looks more bimodal than noraml, with only positive and negative results making it into journals. This evidence is absolutely bonkers and confusing for anyone in clinical practice. If, instead, we publish null results (that come from studies <em>whose results we would have been interested in, regardless of what they come to be</em>), then we can expect meta-analyses to actually represent evidence that is meaningful and representative. </p></li>

<p>* you also can't standardize by using estimated parameters and test for standard normal; that's actually the same thing.</p>

<p>One way to compare would be to supplement the Shapiro-Wilk with a test for specified mean and variance in a normal (combining the tests in some manner), or by having the KS tables adjusted for the parameter estimation (but then it's no longer distribution-free).</p>

<p>There is such a test (equivalent to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov with estimated parameters) - the Lilliefors test; the normality-test version could be validly compared to the Shapiro-Wilk (and will generally have lower power). More competitive is the Anderson-Darling test (which must also be adjusted for parameter estimation for a comparison to be valid).</p>

<hr>

<p>As for what they test - the KS test (and the Lilliefors) looks at the largest difference between the empirical CDF and the specified distribution, while the Shapiro Wilk effectively compares two estimates of variance; the closely related Shapiro-Francia can be regarded as a monotonic function of the squared correlation in a Q-Q plot; if I recall correctly, the Shapiro-Wilk also takes into account covariances between the  order statistics.</p>

<p>Edited to add: While the Shapiro-Wilk nearly always beats the Lilliefors test on alternatives of interest, an example where it doesn't is the <span class=""math-container"">$t_{30}$</span> in medium-large samples (<span class=""math-container"">$n&gt;60$</span>-ish). There the Lilliefors has higher power.</p>

By the end you may have checked the test dataset dozens of times.</p>

<p>I was recently asked if multiple re-sampling of the dataset would be a possible solution. I wanted to say 'no,' but I don't actually know <em>why</em> this is bad. To give a specific example:</p>

<p>Suppose I am looking for the best linear regression given a dataset of 1,000 observations. I split the data into training and testing sets. I formulate a model which is not satisfactory on the testing sample. So, I <em>redistribute</em> the 1,000 observations into new training/test samples and attempt to find a new model. Each model will be trained and tested on their own specific training/test sample, which all come from the same 1,000 original observations.</p>

59136,9554.0,2,,59114.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>In order to use a mixture of Gaussians for your problem, you have to assume that your three measurements are multivariate normal. In that setting, you have many measurements of a mixture of 3 dimensional normals, generated by k different underlying densities. </p>

<p>You could start by setting k=3, one for ""/ shape"", one for ""/\ shape"", and one for ""-- shape"" you mentioned having observed. This will allow you to model the underlying mixture distribution, estimate the covariance of each cluster and of course, classify all measurements. Before comparing them, I would also think about subtracting the mean (and potentially also scaling), since you probably don't care about the general level of an individual, but about the change.</p>

<p>Please provide some details where you found the information about the ""quadratic curves"" you are mentioning, or why you think the Gaussian mixture would classify your measurements using a linear boundary, if you wish to follow up on that. Based on my understanding, the results are labeled based on the likelihood of being generated by a particular density (one of the k you started with). I am not aware of any condition that would restrict the boundary to be a polynomial in the general approach, or even suggest it could be so for that matter.</p>

<p>EDIT (in response to your comment): </p>

<p>The order in your measurements will be captured, since you will encode the morning,afternoon, evening measurements for each individual as a 3dimensional, multivariate normal, with unknown mean and unknown covariance. Imagine there are 3 such Gaussians - one for each characteristic shape of the measurements. </p>

<p>A gaussian mixture model is called a ""mixture"" model since it presumes that the measurements come from a probability, which is some weighted combination of the three underlying Gaussians. Each measurement can have a different weighting.</p>

<p>When you fit the model, you need to infer the parameters of all three Gaussians and simultaneously, infer the responsibility (weighting) of each Gaussian for having generated a particular measurement.</p>

<p>If you find this concept too hard to understand, or if my explanation is completely incomprehensible I would suggest you try a much simpler and much more straightforward approach: k-means.</p>

<p>You simply take the $3xN$ table of data, stick it in a k-means function and set the number of clusters to be 3.
I have written a snippet in R to illustrate:</p>

<p>First I generate some data along the lines of your description.</p>

<pre><code>library(MASS)
library(clue)
library(mclust)    

# Generate training data
Sigma &lt;- diag(3)
mu1 &lt;- c(3,0,3)
mu2 &lt;- c(0,0,0)
mu3 &lt;- c(0,3,0)    

group1 &lt;- mvrnorm(n = 5, mu1, Sigma)
group2 &lt;- mvrnorm(n = 5, mu2, Sigma)
group3 &lt;- mvrnorm(n = 5, mu3, Sigma)    

# Generate test data
new_measurements &lt;- rbind(mvrnorm(n = 2, mu1, Sigma), mvrnorm(n = 2, mu2, Sigma),mvrnorm(n = 2, mu3, Sigma))    
</code></pre>

<p>Here is what it looks like: (I labeled the measurements according to the Gaussian which generated them purely for visual convenience. In your case, your data is not labeled.)</p>

<pre><code># Plot training data and cluster
matplot(t(group1),type=""b"",col=2,lty=1,pch=1)
matplot(t(group2),type=""b"",col=3,lty=1,pch=1,add=T)
matplot(t(group3),type=""b"",col=4,lty=1,pch=1,add=T)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGbyK.png"" alt=""Simulated measurements""></p>

<p>Now we can cluster the data using k-means, by setting the number of cluster to 3, since that is your intuition. (We could also try to investigate what is the right number of clusters using the data.)</p>

<pre><code># Cluster
data &lt;- rbind(group1,group2,group3)
fit &lt;- kmeans(scale(data), 3)
# get cluster means 
cluster_means &lt;- aggregate(data,by=list(fit$cluster),FUN=mean)    
</code></pre>

<p>And we get the mean values for each cluster, which we can then use to make predictions for new measurements.</p>

<pre><code># Predict cluster
fit$centers
predicted_clusters &lt;- cl_predict(fit,scale(new_measurements))
predicted_clusters
</code></pre>

<p>We get the means of the clusters,</p>

<pre><code>        [,1]       [,2]       [,3]
1 -0.8618375 -0.6464979 -0.5279966
2 -0.3605748  0.9793615 -0.5128992
3  1.1221597 -0.6580355  1.0378763
</code></pre>

<p>as well as the predicted cluster for the our new measurements.</p>

<pre><code>Class ids:
[1] 3 3 1 1 2 2
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, k-means correctly predicted to which cluster they belong to, though the k-means estimations of the means are relatively far off. The third cluster corresponds to our first simulated Gaussian with means (3,0,3).</p>

<p>Lastly, we can plot the new data and the estimated means.</p>

<pre><code>matplot(t(cluster_means[,-1]),type=""b"",col=3,lty=1,pch=20,lwd=2,ylim=c(-1,6))
matplot(t(scale(new_measurements)),type=""l"",col=1,lty=1,add=T)

<p>Say you want to know how $X$ maps to $y$.  You fit a model $y=f(X)+\epsilon$.</p>

<p>Then, you want to optimize $X$ to get the best $y$: 
$$y_{max} = argmax_X(\hat{f}(X),s.t. \text{whatever constraints}) $$</p>

<p>This gives you the model's best estimate of the optimal $X$ for getting the biggest $y$.</p>

<p>But obviously $\hat{f}(X)$ is uncertain.  If you take a Bayesian standpoint that $\beta$ is distributed multivariate normal, you can take samples from it, which gives new coefficients (see, for example, <a href=""http://people.bath.ac.uk/sw283/mgcv/check-select.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>).  Taking many samples, using them to pick new optimal values of $X$, one gets a distribution of $y_{max}$ that reflects uncertainty in $\hat{f}(X)$.</p>

<p>Here is the problem:  the central estimate of $y_{max}$ (i.e.: optimizing based on the parameter estimates of the fitted model) is not necessarily the mean or the median of the $y_{max}$ distribution that one gets when optimizing the functions based on the posterior draws.</p>

<p>So what should I do with the ""central estimate""?  Which estimate should I consider to be my ""best guess"" of the value of $y_{max}$?  Should it be $y_{max}$ at the (ML) parameter estimates?  Should it be the mean or median of the posterior simulations of $y_{max}$?</p>

<p>I don't know whether there is a right answer here:  maybe this is a somewhat of a philosophical question?  (Or am I making some relatively fundamental mistake, which makes my whole question moot?  If so, I'd be grateful for replies that point it out.)</p>

It might be useful to really consider what getting all of these missing values might mean though. I'm doubtful you will gain much at all in going through the process of trying to make the imputation.</p>

<p>Consider the mathematical impact of this on your standard error, which is controlled by the square root of N. If you had all 3215 observations then the sqrt of N is 57. If you lose 20% it's 51. That's only a difference of about 11% in terms of what your standard error will be and consequently, smaller impact on your <em>t</em> than you might think adding in ~643 subjects would yield. Your effect, correlation, and variance estimates should all be pretty stable by the time the N is that high so those won't change much at all, and not in any predictable direction.</p>

<p>In other words, getting all of this data could change your <em>t</em> from 2 to 2.2.  Given that any imputation is fraught with complication in explanation and limitations in your conclusions, is that worth it to you? </p>

<p>A further thing to consider is that if you don't have a significant effect already, with the N you have, but you believe the effect really exists, then you have a really small effect. Let's say you currently have a non-significant <em>t</em>. If that's true then Cohen's D is under 0.04. Is that a value that's meaningful in light of your theory?</p>

<p>Of course, this assumes there's no bias from the missing data. That could change things. In that case then perhaps you should strive to impute but you'd need some argument to support the idea. That would require knowledge about those subjects or hypotheses that are supported externally that strongly support an expectation of bias. If you do have a strong reason to expect that your missing subjects are part of a group that will bias the data then perhaps that should be a variable in the analysis.</p>

My understanding was that they could include correlated data meant they could include responses from the same participants (within-subjects effects modelled as random effects), not that you could include the underlying data that gives the participant response estimate.</p>

<p>My question is, can you include the underlying data collected from the multiple responses of each participant in the <em>same condition</em>, i.e. can you do this:</p>

<pre><code>library(nlme)
lme1 &lt;- lme(response ~ 1, random= ~ 1|id/condition, data=data.full, method=""ML"")
lme2 &lt;- update(lme1, .~. + condition)
anova(lme1, lme2)

# X(1) = 3.19, p = .07, not significant
</code></pre>

<p>Or should you do this:</p>

<pre><code>lme1 &lt;- lme(mean.response ~ 1, random= ~ 1|id/condition, data=data.means, method=""ML"")
lme2 &lt;- update(lme1, .~. + condition)
anova(lme1, lme2)

# X(1) = 5.25, p = .02, significant

<p>On <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-010-9606-0#page-1"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> they used the Standardized Selection Ratio (SSR) in order to know what is the preferred host (anemone) of anemonefish.</p>

<p>Here is a quotation coming from their methods:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The “preferred host” of anemonefish was assessed calculating the “Standardized
      Selection Ratio (SSR)” (values between 0 and 1) (Manly et al. 1993). Manly’s standardized
      selection ratio represents the probability that an individual will use a particular habitat
      type, taking into account the different resource availability. For each anemonefish species ($i$) inhabiting an anemone species ($j$), SSR was calculated as:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>$$SSR = \frac{w_i}{\sum{w_j}} $$</p>

<p>where $w_i = \frac{o_i}{p_j}$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$o_i$ is the relative frequency of the anemonefish species $i$ and $p_j$ the relative frequency
      of the anemone species $j$. Higher values of SSR indicate a strong preference for the
      selected resource. The Log- Likelihood statistic ($\chi^2$L) (Manly et al. 1993) was used to
      check the significance of the observed distribution under a null hypothesis of a random
      host choice.</p>

It has been called the ""hierarchical ordering principle"" and also sometimes the ""sparsity-of-effects principle.""</p>

<p>In the chapter on fractional factorial designs in Montgomery (2013, p. 290), he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The successful use of fractional factorial designs is based on three key ideas:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><em>The sparsity of effects principle</em>. When there are several variables, the system or process is likely to be driven primarily by some of the main effects and low-order interactions.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wu &amp; Hamada (2000, p. 143) instead call this the ""hierarchical ordering principle"", and use the phrase ""sparsity of effects"" to refer to a related but distinct observation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Three fundamental principles for factorial effects:</p>
  
  <p><em>Hierarchical ordering principle</em>: (i) Lower order effects are more likely to be important than higher order effects, (ii) effects of the same order are likely to be equally important .</p>
  
  <p><em>Effect sparsity principle</em>: The number of relatively important effects in a factorial experiment is small.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Li, Sudarsanam, &amp; Frey (2006, p. 34) give two possible explanations for why hierarchical ordering should tend to occur. First they suggest that it is ""partly due to the range over which experimenters typically explore factors"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the limit that experimenters explore small changes in factors and to the degree that systems exhibit continuity of responses and their derivatives, linear effects of factors tend to dominate. Therefore, to the extent that hierarchical ordering is common in experimentation, it is due to the fact that many experiments are conducted for the purpose of minor refinement rather than broad-scale exploration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They next suggest that it is ""partly determined by the ability of experimenters to transform the inputs and outputs of the system to obtain a parsimonious description of system behavior"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, it is well known to aeronautical engineers that the lift and drag of wings is more simply described as a function of wing area and aspect ratio than by wing span and chord. Therefore, when conducting experiments to guide wing design, engineers are likely to use the product of span and chord (wing area) and the ratio of span and chord (the aspect ratio) as the independent variables</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, one clarification question:</p>

<pre><code>""A power of 0.8 means that of ten true hypotheses tested, only two will be ruled out &gt; because their effects are not picked up in the

  I found in textbook, which is the probability of rejecting the null as
  a function of parameter θ. With different θ we have different power,
  so I don't quite understand the above quote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Power is a function of θ, variance, and sample size. I am not sure what the confusion is. Also for many cases in which significance testing is used null hypothesis of mean1=mean2 is always false. In these cases <em>significance</em> is only a function of sample size. Please read Paul Meehl's <a href=""http://mres.gmu.edu/pmwiki/uploads/Main/Meehl1967.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">""Theory-Testing in Psychology and Physics: A Methodological Paradox""</a> it clarified many things for me and I have never seen an adequate response. Paul Meehl has a few other papers on this you can find by searching his name. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my field of political science / economics, scholars simply use up
  all the country-year data available. Thus, should we not be concerned
  with sample fiddling here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you read the Simmons 2011 paper this is only one of the ""p-hacking"" techniques mentioned. If it is true that there is only one data set and no one picks out selective samples from it then I guess there is no room for increasing sample size.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can the problem of running multiple tests but reporting only one model
  be fixed simply by the fact that someone else in the discipline will
  re-test your paper and strike you down immediately for not having
  robust results? Anticipating this, scholars in my field are more
  likely to include a robustness check section, where they show that
  multiple model specifications does not change the result. Is this
  sufficient?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If replication was occurring without publication bias there would be no need for ""journals of the null result"". I would say the robustness check section is good to have but is not sufficient in the presence of researchers failing to publish what they consider null results. Also I would not consider a result robust just because multiple analysis techniques on the same data come to the same conclusion. A robust result is one that makes a correct prediction of effect/correlation/etc on <strong>new data</strong>. </p>

<p>A replication is not getting p&lt;0.05 both times. The theory should be considered more robust if it predicted a different effect/correlation/etc than used in the first study. I do not refer to the presence of an effect or correlation, but the precise value or a small range of values compared to possible range of values. The presence of increased/decreased effect or positive/negative correlation are 100% likely to be true in the case of the null hypothesis being false. Read Meehl.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Andrew Gelman and others raise the point that no matter the data, it
  would be always possible to find and publish some ""pattern"" that isn't
  really there. But this should not be a concern, given the fact that
  any empirical ""pattern"" must be supported by a theory, and rival
  theories within a discipline will just engage in an debate / race to
  find which camp is able to find more ""patterns"" in various places. If
  a pattern is truly spurious, then the theory behind will be quickly
  struck down when there is no similar pattern in other samples /
  settings. Isn't this how science progresses?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science cannot function properly if researchers are failing to publish null results. Also just because the pattern was not discovered in the second sample/setting does not mean it does not exist under the conditions of the initial study.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming that the current trend of journals for null result will
  actually flourish, is there a way for us to aggregate all the null and
  positive results together and make an inference on the theory that

<p>This would be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">meta-analysis</a>. There is nothing special about null results in this case other than that researchers do not publish them because the p-values were above the arbitrary threshold. In the presence of publication bias meta-analysis is unreliable as is the entire literature suffering from publication bias. While it can be useful, meta analysis is far inferior for assessing a theory than having that theory make a precise prediction that is then tested. Publication bias does not matter nearly as much as long as new predictions pan out and are replicated by independent groups.</p>

<p>In general, I agree with the original hypotheses that higher-order terms are often associated with smaller variances.  But, this also depends on the type of data.</p>

<p>In plant breeding, a rule of thumb (Gauch, 1996, page 90) for multi-environment trials is that the variation in the data is:
70% location,
20% location-by-variety,
10% variety</p>

<p>Very approximate, but it is fairly consistent that the higher-order term ""location-by-variety"" variance is larger than the main-effect ""variety"" variance.</p>

<p>This is untrue. This could be done with GLMs for example. Or via resampling. </p>

<p>Non-normality may not be the biggest issue you have (heteroskedasticity tends to have a bigger impact, one that doesn't diminish so nicely with sample size)</p>

<p>A nonlinear transformation will change many things. In your case, the important ones are distributional shape, variance of the transformed variables, and what means on the transformed scale correspond to on the original scale and vice versa. (In a regression situation there's also the impact on linearity of relationships)</p>

<p>You might choose a transformation that takes you to nearly constant variance. You might choose one that takes you to near symmetry. You might choose one that does either of those things less well, but is more interpretable. </p>

<p>If you're very lucky, you might be in a situation that gets you more than one of those at once.</p>

In each experiment, you collect triplicate measurements. The triplicates tend to be fairly close together, compared to the differences among the three experimental means. Computing the grand mean is pretty easy. But how can one compute a confidence interval for the grand mean?</p>

<p>Sample data:</p>

<p>Experiment 1:   34, 41, 39</p>

<p>Experiment 3:   29, 31, 35</p>

<p>Assume that the replicate values within an experiment follow a Gaussian distribution, as does the mean values of each experiment. The SD of variation within an experiment is smaller than the SD among experimental means. Assume also that there is no ordering of the three values in each experiment.

<p>The simple approach is to first compute the mean of each experiment: 38.0, 49.3, and 31.7, and then compute the mean, and its 95% confidence interval, of those three values. Using this method, the grand mean is 39.7 with the 95% confidence interval ranging from 17.4 to 61.9. </p>

The papers on the topic breeze over it, making me think I'm missing something obvious...</p>

<p>Perplexity is seen as a good measure of performance for LDA. The idea is that you keep a holdout sample, train your LDA on the rest of the data, then calculate the perplexity of the holdout. </p>

<p>The perplexity could be given by the formula:</p>

<p>$per(D_{test})=exp\{-\frac{\sum_{d=1}^{M}\log p(\mathbb{w}_d)}{\sum_{d=1}^{M}N_d}\} $</p>

<p>(Taken from <a href=""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1282280.1282283"">Image retrieval on large-scale image databases, Horster et al</a>.)</p>

<p>Here  $M$ is the number of documents (in the test sample, presumably), $\mathbb{w}_d$ represents the words in document $d$, $N_d$ the number of words in document $d$.</p>

<p>It is not clear to me how to sensibly calcluate $p(\mathbb{w}_d)$, since we don't have topic mixtures for the held out documents. Ideally, we would integrate over the Dirichlet prior for all possible topic mixtures and use the topic multinomials we learned. Calculating this integral doesn't seem an easy task however.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we could attempt to learn an optimal topic mixture for each held out document (given our learned topics) and use this to calculate the perplexity. This would be doable, however it's not as trivial as papers such as Horter et al and Blei et al seem to suggest, and it's not immediately clear to me that the result will be equivalent to the ideal case above.</p>

To forecast the population’s trajectory, I have used ARIMA modeling.  Examination of the ACF and PACF of the first-order differenced time-series suggested a 10-year cycle exists.  So I used a span 10 seasonal difference to account for this periodic pattern.  Therefore, the response variable was:
$$
Y_t=(\sqrt{N_t}-\sqrt{N_{t-1}})-(\sqrt{N_{t-10}}-\sqrt{N_{t-11}})

Typically, I would have used a logarithmic transformation but it resulted in heteroscedastic residuals.  Examination of the ACF and PACF of $Y_t$ indicated a multiplicative seasonal structure so I fit the model:

ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)_{10}
$$
using the Forecast Package in <code>R</code>....<code>library(forecast)</code>.</p>

<p>My question is: can I use subject ID as a random effect? </p>

<p>Some researchers would like to put you to sleep.  Depending on the secret toss of a fair coin, they will briefly awaken you either once (Heads) or twice (Tails).  After each waking, they will put you back to sleep with a drug that makes you forget that awakening.  When you are awakened, to what degree should <em>you</em> believe that the outcome of the coin toss was Heads?</p>
<p><em>(OK, maybe you don’t want to be the subject of this experiment!  Suppose instead that Sleeping Beauty (SB) agrees to it (with the full approval of the Magic Kingdom’s Institutional Review Board, of course).  She’s about to go to sleep for one hundred years, so what are one or two more days, anyway?)</em></p>

<p><em>[Detail of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxfield_Parrish"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maxfield Parrish</a> illustration.]</em></p>
<h3>Are you a Halfer or a Thirder?</h3>
<p><strong>The Halfer position.</strong>  Simple! The coin is fair--and SB knows it--so she should believe there's a one-half chance of heads.</p>
<p><strong>The Thirder position.</strong> Were this experiment to be repeated many times, then the coin will be heads only one third of the time SB is awakened.  Her probability for heads will be one third.</p>
<h3>Thirders have a problem</h3>
<p>Most, but not all, people who have written about this are thirders.  But:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On Sunday evening, just before SB falls asleep, she must believe the chance of heads is one-half: that’s what it means to be a fair coin.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whenever SB awakens, <em>she has learned absolutely nothing she did not know Sunday night.</em>  What rational argument can she give, then, for stating that her belief in heads is now one-third and not one-half?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some attempted explanations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>SB would necessarily lose money if she were to bet on heads with any odds other than 1/3.  (Vineberg, <em>inter alios</em>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>One-half really is correct: just use the Everettian “many-worlds” interpretation of Quantum Mechanics!  (Lewis).</p>
</li>
<li><p>SB updates her belief based on self-perception of her “temporal location” in the world.  (Elga, <em>i.a.</em>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>SB is confused: “[It] seems more plausible to say that her epistemic state upon waking up should not include a definite degree of belief in heads. … The real issue is how one deals with known, unavoidable, cognitive malfunction.”  [Arntzenius]</p>

40104,14684.0,1,,,,The weighted sum of two independent Poisson random variables,<distributions><poisson-distribution>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Using wikipedia I found a way to calculate the probability mass function resulting from the sum of two Poisson random variables. However, I think that the approach I have is wrong.</p>

<p>Let $X_1, X_2$ be two independent Poisson random variables with mean $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$, and $S_2 =  a_1 X_1+a_2 X_2$, where the $a_1$ and $a_2$ are constants, then the probability-generating function of $S_2$ is given by
$$
G_{S_2}(z) = \operatorname{E}(z^{S_2})= \operatorname{E}(z^{a_1 X_1+a_2 X_2}) G_{X_1}(z^{a_1})G_{X_2}(z^{a_2}).
$$
Now, using the fact that the probability-generating function for a Poisson random variable is $G_{X_i}(z) = \textrm{e}^{\lambda_i(z - 1)}$, we can write the probability-generating function of the sum of the two independent Poisson random variables as
$$
\begin{aligned}
G_{S_2}(z) &amp;= \textrm{e}^{\lambda_1(z^{a_1} - 1)}\textrm{e}^{\lambda_2(z^{a_2} - 1)}  \\
&amp;= \textrm{e}^{\lambda_1(z^{a_1} - 1)+\lambda_2(z^{a_2} - 1)}.
\end{aligned}
$$
It seems that the probability mass function of $S_2$ is recovered by taking derivatives of $G_{S_2}(z)$ $\operatorname{Pr}(S_2 = k) = \frac{G_{S_2}^{(k)}(0)}{k!}$, where $G_{S_2}^{(k)} = \frac{d^k G_{S_2}(z)}{ d z^k}$.</p>

<p>Is this is correct? I have the feeling I cannot just take the derivative to obtain the probability mass function, because of the constants $a_1$ and $a_2$. Is this right? Is there an alternative approach?</p>

<p>If this is correct can I now obtain an approximation of the cumulative distribution by truncating the infinite sum over all k?</p>

40870,1923.0,1,,,,False discovery rate calculation in target-decoy matching context,<terminology><false-discovery-rate>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>A common strategy in mass spectrometry of biological molecules is to upload observed spectra to a server so that they can be matched to a LARGE database of theoretical spectra of known molecules (a.k.a. <em>target</em> database). In order to control for false positives, a <em>decoy</em> database consisting of incorrect/irrelevant spectra is used.</p>

<p>I have been reading more into this subject and have come up some questions regarding the calculation of the FDR measure from this target-decoy strategy. The basic idea of the FDR value is very intuitive: </p>

<p>$FDR = \frac{FP}{FP + TP}$</p>

<p>where FP and TP stands for false and true positives respectively. This makes perfect sense to me; if I'm trying to guess some peoples' names out of a phone book, and get 8 right and 2 wrong, I would have 2 <em>false</em> out of 10 <em>total</em> guesses, and thus my false discovery rate would be 20%.</p>

<p>However reading <a href=""http://www.proteored.org/pme6/fdr_calculation_for_pme6.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a> on how this is done in large scale on the servers, I got introduced to two different calculations, depending on whether or not the <em>target</em> and <em>decoy</em> databases are concatenated (page 2).</p>

<p>I don't think that this is a typo as I found other occurrences <sup>*</sup> of the mysterious factor 2 in front of FP in scientific literature. However the motivation behind this is never explained (at least I couldn't find it). </p>

<p>I would appreciate some insight on where this doubling comes from. Likewise I wonder whether or not FDR calculation this way <strong>assumes</strong> that the error rate for each spectra match is the same for the target database and decoy database (i.e. <em>assuming</em> that getting 25 decoy hits <em>implies</em> 25 target hits are also false positives). It's not really clear for me why the error rate has to be the same for the two databases. Any comments on this subject is also appreciated.</p>

<p>My main problem is that I couldn't find a package (R/bioconductor) that would do it out of the box easily, so if you know about such a package, please let me know. In the meantime, this is what I figured out: I would run a sliding window over the whole genome and simply count number of differentially expressed genes in each window - this should tell me where I have the most differentially expressed genes in the genome. However, it will be dependent on gene density, so to obtain some sort of background distribution, I would run permutations of the samples (or p values), say, 1000 times, and check how often I am likely to find this number of windows with that number of differentially expressed genes compared to the observed numbers. Does this sound right?</p>

<p>I would like a way to graph these relationships, to more easily communicate these complex results in papers and to colleagues who aren't statistically oriented. I imagine this is very easy to do in R using some kind of simple network graphics package, but I simply don't know how.</p>

<p>Could anyone please point me in the right direction. Below is code to reproduce an example dataset. Each vector xi represents the classification of 100 observations, in a model with i possible classes. I want to graph how observations (rows) move from class to class across the columns. </p>

<pre><code>x1 &lt;- sample(1:1, 100, replace=T)
x2 &lt;- sample(1:2, 100, replace=T)
x3 &lt;- sample(1:3, 100, replace=T)
x4 &lt;- sample(1:4, 100, replace=T)
x5 &lt;- sample(1:5, 100, replace=T)

results &lt;- cbind (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)
</code></pre>

<p>I imagine there is a way to produce a graph where the nodes are classifications and the edges reflect (by weights, or color maybe) the % of observations moving from classifications from one model to the next. E.g. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/muEii.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>UPDATE: Having some progress with the igraph package. Starting from the code above...</p>

<p>poLCA results recycle the same numbers to describe class membership, so you need to do a bit of recoding. </p>

<pre><code>N&lt;-ncol(results) 
n&lt;-0
for(i in 2:N) {
results[,i]&lt;- (results[,i])+((i-1)+n)
n&lt;-((i-1)+n)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to get all the cross-tabulations and their frequencies, and rbind them into one matrix defining all the edges. There is probably a much more elegant way to do this. </p>

<li>Model<br>
The firm and enforcement agency interact in more than one domain. This may arise because a single agency is responsible for enforcing more than one regulation or because it enforces the same regulation at more than one constituent plant of a multi-plant firm.
For simplicity we will assume that the number of domains is two and that they are ex ante identical. In each domain the firm is required to comply with a regulation. If it complies it inflicts no environmental damage otherwise it inflicts damage d, which is commonly observed. The cost to the ith firm of compliance in domain j [ h1, 2j will be denoted cij where ci 1 and ci 2 are independent, privately observed draws from a distribution f(c) with associated cumulative F(c). F is common knowledge.<br>
If the agency observes non-compliance by a firm in either domain it can take that firm to court (‘‘pursue’’ the firm), in which case the firm is subject to a penalty L which is exogenous. Penalties are assumed to be restricted in the sense that
F(L) &lt; 1. This implies that a policy of full-pursuit, whereby the agency pursues all 3
violations, will not generate full-compliance.
The firm and enforcement agency are both risk neutral and aim to maximise
expected profit and minimise expected environmental damage respectively.</li>

45804,17580.0,1,,,,Finding the similarity between two functions,<similarities><genetic-algorithms><function><kolmogorov-smirnov-test>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I am a first-year grad student in Computer Science, and I need some help with a problem that I think is statistically oriented. I have taken a statistics course, but it was abysmal and I haven't had time to rectify that. But anyway, my problem stems from a project I'm working on involving genetic programming, where I'm randomly generating functions. Please bear with my description, as it's been a while since I've had a formal theory course too.</p>

<p>I have two continuous (but not onto) functions <strong>F</strong> and <strong>G</strong>, both of which map <strong>N</strong> variables to a single output. The domain of the input variables is the integers between -100 and 100. The range of the output is the Real numbers. I want to find some statistical measure of how ""similar"" the two functions are; given the finite inputs (of which there will be 201^N possible), how much variance(?) there is between the two functions outputs. Two identical functions should return no variance, and two wildly different functions should return a high variance.</p>

<p>Since <strong>N</strong> will typically be greater than 6, I can't iterate through all the possible inputs and compare the outputs, so I figured I could take some sampling at regular intervals (e.g. every multiple of 10, so that it's only 10^N). But here's about where I realize I have no idea what I'm doing. How do I determine if two numbers are ""highly variant"" from each other? What sample size do I need to use to have confidence in my results?</p>

<p>My current approach is to compare the functions with a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Since that test doesn't seem to scale well to multi-variate problems, I've taken advantage of my limited domains to just treat the problem as having a single variable by concatenating my variables. So the first value of the variable is (-100:100:100:100:100:100), the second is (-100:100:100:100:100:099), and the last is (100:100:100:100:100:100). Does that even make sense?</p>

Fitting <code>glm.nb</code> on random data generated by <code>rnbinom</code> for various choices of $\mu$ and <code>size</code> seems to support the thesis that $\theta = 1/\kappa$ (i.e. that $\theta$ = <code>size</code>) but also that for large values of size the estimation is poor.</p>

We aim to make inference about the effectiveness of a pre-post intervention in a group, potentially adjusting for several covariates and determining whether there is effect modification by a group that received particularly different training as part of an intervention.</p>

<p>Given data of the following form:</p>

<pre><code>id phase resp
1  pre   1
1  post  0
2  pre   0
2  post  0
3  pre   1

<p>And a $2 \times 2$ contingency table of paired response information:</p>

<p>\begin{array}{cc|cc}
&amp; &amp; \mbox{Pre} &amp; \\ 
&amp; &amp; \mbox{Correct} &amp; \mbox{Incorrect} \\ \hline
\mbox{Post} &amp; \mbox{Correct} &amp; a &amp; b&amp;\\
 &amp; \mbox{Incorrect} &amp; c&amp; d&amp;\\
\end{array}</p>

<p>We're interested in the test of hypothesis: $\mathcal{H}_0: \theta_c = 1$.</p>

<p>McNemar's Test gives: $Q = \frac{(b-c)^2}{b+c} \sim \chi^2_1$ under $\mathcal{H}_0$ (asymptotically). This is intuitive because, under the null, we would expect an equal proportion of the discordant pairs ($b$ and $c$) to be favoring a positive effect ($b$) or a negative effect ($c$). With the probability of positive case definition defined $p  =\frac{b}{b+c}$ and $n=b+c$. The odds of observing a positive discordant pair is $\frac{p}{1-p}=\frac{b}{c}$.</p>

<p>On the other hand, conditional logistic regression uses a different approach to test the same hypothesis, by maximizing the conditional likelihood:</p>

<p>$$\mathcal{L}(X ; \beta) = \prod_{j=1}^n \frac{\exp(\beta X_{j,2})}{\exp(\beta X_{j,1}) +  \exp(\beta X_{j,2})}$$</p>

<p>where $\exp(\beta) = \theta_c$.</p>

<p>So, what's the relationship between these tests? How can one do a simple test of the contingency table presented earlier? Looking at calibration of p-values from clogit and McNemar's approaches under the null, you'd think they were completely unrelated!</p>

<p><a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/5278/how-to-visualize-what-anova-does"">How to visualize what ANOVA does?</a></p>

<p>As stated in the first post, to test whether the average height of male and females is the same you can use a regression model ($y = \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon$, where $y$ denotes height and $x$ denotes gender) and test whether $\beta = 0$. If $\beta = 0$, then there is no difference in the height between males and females. However, I am not quite sure how this is tested when you have three groups. Imagine the following example:</p>

<pre><code>height (y) -  group (x)
5          -  A
6          -  A
7          -  A
6          -  A
30         -  B
32         -  B
34         -  B
33         -  B 
20         -  C
19         -  C
21         -  C
22         -  C
</code></pre>

<p>The regression model would look like:</p>

<p>$$y = a+ b x + \epsilon$$</p>

<p>I quickly visualized the data (see image below)</p>

<p>They way I understood the regression model is that it would now test whether
any of the three slopes (AB, AC or BC) has a slope $b$ which is significantly different from 0. If that's the case one can conclude like in an ANOVA that there is at least one group in which height is significantly different from one or more groups. Afterwards, one could use a post-hoc test of course to test which of the groups really differ. Is my understanding of how the regression models tests this hypothesis correct?</p>

Every time I think I understand it I realise that I am wrong. Most of the code examples I find on-line implement something that is not consistent with the description. i.e.: They say they implement Metropolis-Hastings but they actually implement random-walk metropolis. Others (almost always) silently skip the implementation of the Hastings correction ratio because they are using a symmetric proposal distribution. Actually, I haven't found a single simple example that calculates the ratio so far. That makes me even more confused. Can someone give me code examples (in any language) of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vanilla Non-Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm with Hastings correction ratio calculation (even if this will end up being 1 when using a symmetric proposal distribution).</li>
<li>Vanilla Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.</li>
<li>Vanilla Independent Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<p>No need to provide the Metropolis algorithms because if I am not mistaken the only difference between Metropolis and Metropolis-Hastings is that the first ones always sample from a symmetric distribution and thus they don't have the Hastings correction ratio.
No need to give detailed explanation of the algorithms. I do understand the basics but I am kinda confused with all the different names for the different variations of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm but also with how you practically implement the Hastings correction ratio on the Vanilla non-random-walk MH. Please don't copy paste links that partially answer my questions because most likely I have already seen them. Those links led me to this confusion. Thank you.</p>

<p>$$
n_\text{eff} = \frac{n}{\tau}
$$</p>

<p>independent samples instead of $n$ correlated ones for the purposes of finding the mean.  Estimating $\tau$ from data is non-trivial, but there are a few ways of doing it (see <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0175"">Thompson 2010</a>).</p>

<p>The definition without absolute values, $\tau_a$, seems more common in the literature; but it admits the possibility of $\tau_a&lt;1$.  Using R and the ""coda"" package:</p>

<pre><code>require(coda)
ts.uncorr &lt;- arima.sim(model=list(),n=10000)         # white noise 
ts.corr &lt;- arima.sim(model=list(ar=-0.5),n=10000)    # AR(1)

    # result should be close to 10000
effectiveSize(ts.corr)
    # result is in the neighborhood of 30000... ???
</code></pre>

<p>The ""effectiveSize"" function in ""coda"" uses a definition of the autocorrelation time equivalent to $\tau_a$, above.  There are some other R packages out there that compute effective sample size or autocorrelation time, and all the ones I've tried give results consistent with this:  that an AR(1) process with a negative AR coefficient has <em>more</em> effective samples than the correlated time series.  This seems strange.  </p>

<p>Obviously, this can never happen in the $\tau_b$ definition of autocorrelation time.</p>

Because these results depend on the condition number, I'd like to have some idea about the typical sizes of a condition numbers that crop up in social science research. That way, I can give some guidance about how large the sample size has to be before we reach the happy land of asymptopia.  </p>

<p>I'd be happy for any guidance. </p>

<p><strong>My very specific</strong> setup is as follows. For the standard Generalized Least Squares (GLS) model</p>

<p>$$Y = X\beta + e \quad \quad \quad e \sim N(0, V\sigma^2) $$</p>

<p>where $V$ is assumed to be known and positive definite, we define </p>

<p>$$ X^- = (X^\top X)^{-1} X^\top \quad \quad \quad U = (I-XX^-)V$$

<p>$$ \kappa = \frac{ \lambda_{\text{max}} }{ \lambda_{\text{min}} } $$</p>

<p>where the $\lambda_\star$ values are the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the matrix $U$.  </p>

<p>Does anyone have pointers to references for the sizes of condition numbers in social science research? I don't even know where to look. Any pointers for either </p>

<p><strong>What I want to do</strong> is something slightly different:</p>

<p>I want to estimate parameter and prediction uncertainty for an algorithm that estimates some environmental variable.</p>

<p>What I have is a error-free time-series (from a simulation) of that variable, <code>x_true</code>, to which I add some noise, <code>x_noise</code>, in order to generate a synthetic dataset <code>x</code>.
I then try to find optimal parameters by fitting my algorithm with the sum of squares <code>sum((x_estimate - x_true)^2)</code> (! not <code>x_estimate - x</code> !) as an objective function. In order to see how my algorithm performs and to create samples of my parameters' distributions, I want to resample <code>x_noise</code>, add it to <code>x_true</code>, fit my model again, rinse and repeat. Is that a valid approach to assess parameter uncertainty? Can I interpret the fits to the bootstrapped datasets as prediction uncertainty, or do I have to follow the procedure I posted above?</p>

<p>/edit: I think I haven't really made clear what my model does. Think of it as essentially something like a de-noising method. It's not a predictive model, it's an algorithm that tries to extract the underlying signal of a noisy time-series of environmental data.</p>

There's an auction site where borrowers ask for some money and lenders bid on them until the borrower is fully funded and the auction ends. There's lots of information on each loan request.

Right now, I sell at the minimum markup, so that with fees I barely make a profit.</p>

<p>What I'm not sure is what markup I should sell? The lower the markup the faster my loan parts sell, but I will get less profit too. On what loans should I bid? Should I bid on a loan auction with a higher interest rate, but which is not going to end for several days, thereby leaving my money stale, or should I bid on an auction with a lower interest rate, but which is going to end very soon. Sometimes in the former case, the borrower might decide to take the loan and not wait until the end of the auction, thereby I could secure a better interest rate than just bidding on the loan auction due to end soon.</p>

<p>Thus, to give a simple example, suppose I'm predicting $x_{t+1} = \sum \beta_j x_j, j&lt;t+1$, I would like to add another weight witch accounts for the probability of $x_j$, something like $x_{t+1} = \sum f(x_j)\beta_j x_j, j&lt;t+1$ where $f(x_j)$ is proportional to $P(x_j)$. </p>

The measure is symmetrical as seen from the definition. To make the measure more ""legible"" and similar to the traditional measures, I compute distance$=(1-D)$ from formula (1).

From this table I took a d value of 0.264 based on a signficance value of 0.10 and a sample size of 20. Plot B below shows my result. My interpretation of Plot B is that after running a life test on 20 samples that if the resulting reliability plot does not fall below the lower boundary shown in Plot B then we have met the requirements.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ilZqf.png"" alt=""Plot B]![enter image description here""></p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Did I translate the Part 2 requirement properly when I used an alpha of 0.10 to obtain the KS critical value of 0.264 ?  In other words, does a 90% confidence equal a 0.10 significance within the KS context ? If not, can someone provide guidance ?</p></li>
<li><p>How would <em>you</em> interpret Plot B ?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Response to owensmartin's answer</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I'll take your ""your reasoning is not incorrect"" statement as a big vote of confidence. I just have a few items below that I'd appreciate comments from anyone on.</p>

<p>a. You are right in that my reliability functions are also survival functions. I believe the Nominal curve is simply the compliment of the nominal CDF.</p>

<p>b. Although I haven't computed the statistical power, I'm not that surprised when you say it is ""very low at this sample size"". However our customer is comfortable with the sample size of 20 and by extension the resulting low power.</p>

<p>c. Our customer is also comfortable with using the referenced Military Handbook and the associated KS critical values shown therein even though they may be approximate. As time permits I'm hoping to learn how to compute these critical values ""exactly"" so as not to have to rely on the handbook values.</p>

<p>d. To answer your question as to whether I really need the Weibull fit ? The short answer is no as there is nothing particularly ""magical"" about the Weibull distribution. The slightly longer answer is that I'm not sure how else to produce a nominal survival curve that I can then apply the d value of 0.264 to. The nominal curve shown in Plot B was constructed by solving the two simultaneous equations for the shape parameter and characteristic life knowing that R[4] =0.95 and R[8]=0.85 meet the requirements. This is shown in Plot A. I suspect that other commonly used distribution types may not be able to meet both of these requirements simultaneously. But because of the inherent flexibility of the Weibull, it <em>is</em> able.</p>

<p>e. As for being sure about the 90% confidence, I think as long as the fitted distribution resulting from the 20 sample life test does not drop below the lower boundary shown in Plot B would you agree that we can say we are 90% confident we meet the stated requirements? The only exception I can see to this is if when fitting the test data to a distribution that if the degree of fit is so poor as to raise question to its validity. But in solving engineering problems, this is always present as a concern that needs to be dealt with.</p>

<p>f. Regarding failed vs didn't fail test results, we normally strive for having each of the 20 samples fail so that we can avoid dealing with the added uncertainty associated with censored or suspended data points. We achieve this via accelerated-life testing methods which essentially compresses time by increasing either the duty cycle and/or the stress value(s).</p>

<p>Thanks for any further insight into this.</p>

<p>I started with applying logistic regression, but having so much missing entries I feel that this is not a good approach as glm discard all records which have any item blank. So I am now looking to apply tree based algorithms (<code>rpart</code> or <code>gbm</code>) which are capable to handle missing data in a better way. </p>

Here's a summary of the problem:</p>

<p>""A railroad numbers its locomotives in order 1..N. One day you see a locomotive with the number 60. Estimate how many locomotives the railroad has.""</p>

<p>This solution is found with the likelihood function and exponential prior like so:</p>

<pre><code>class Train(Suite):
  def __init__(self, hypos, alpha=1.0):
    # Create an exponential prior
    Pmf.__init__(self)
    for hypo in hypos:
      self.Set(hypo, hypo**(-alpha))
    self.Normalize()
  def Likelihood(self, data, hypo):
    if hypo &lt; data:
      return 0
    else:
      return (1.0/hypo)
</code></pre>

<p>Conceptually this is saying, if we see a train number larger than one of our hypotheses (1...1000) then every hypothesis that's smaller has a zero chance of being correct. The rest of the hypotheses have a 1/number_of_trains chance of showing us a train with this number.</p>

<p>In the exercise I'm working on the author then adds on a little extra. This assumes there's only one company. In real life however you'd have a mixture of big and small companies and bigger companies (both equally likely). However, this would mean that you're more likely to see a train from a bigger company since they'd have more trains.</p>

<p>Now the question is how to reflect this in the likelihood function?</p>

<p>This isn't Stack Overflow so I'm not really asking for coding help, but instead perhaps just help about how I might think about this problem in terms of a likelihood function.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that, independently of any argument showing that the first term is always equal to zero, one can see that setting <span class=""math-container"">$g(X) = E(Y|X)$</span> minimizes the expression as it implies <span class=""math-container"">$\big(E(Y|X)  - g(X)\big) =0$</span> and hence</p>

<p>For concreteness, let's say an exponential distribution with unknown mean and a sample size of say 100. </p>

<p>In order to get a reasonable number of expected observations per bin some account would need to be taken of the data (e.g. if we chose to put 6 bins below the mean and 4 above it, that would still be using data-based bin boundaries). </p>

<p>But this use of bins based on seeing the data would presumably affect the distribution of the test statistic under the null. </p>

<p>I have seen plenty of discussion about the fact that - <em>if</em> the parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood from the <em>binned</em> data - you lose 1 d.f per estimated parameter (an issue dating right back to Fisher vs Karl Pearson) - but I don't recall reading anything about finding the bin boundaries themselves based on the data. (If you estimate them from the unbinned data, then with $k$ bins the distribution of the test statistic lies somewhere between a $\chi^2_{k}$ and a $\chi^2_{k-p}$.) </p>

<p>Does this data-based choice of bins substantively impact significance level or power? Are there some approaches that matter more than others? If there is much of an effect, is it something that goes away in large samples?</p>

<p>If it does have a substantive impact, this would seem to make the use of a chi-squared test when parameters are unknown almost useless in many cases (in spite of still being advocated in quite a few texts), unless you had a good a-priori estimate of the parameter.</p>

<p>Discussion of the issues or pointers to references (preferably with a mention of their conclusions) would be useful.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit, pretty much an aside to the main question:</p>

<p>It occurs to me that there are potential solutions for the specific case of the exponential* (and the uniform come to think of it), but I am still interested in the more general issue of the impact choosing bin boundaries.</p>

<p>* For example, for the exponential, one might use the smallest observation (say it is equal to $m$) to get a very rough idea of where to place the bins (since the smallest observation is exponential with mean $\mu/n$), and then test the remaining $n-1$ differences ($x_i - m$) for exponentiality. Of course that might yield a very poor estimate of $\mu$, and hence poor bin choices, though I suppose one might use the argument recursively in order to take the lowest two or three observations from which to choose reasonable bins and then test the differences of the remaining observations above the largest of those smallest order statistics for exponentiality)</p>

<p>The sampling method used in these surveys are biased and I have sampling weights calculated(with respect to the population) for each data point in each study.</p>

<p>The question is, how would I be able to combine the 5 datasets and have the weights recalculated so as to obtain one giant dataset for analysis on this population?</p>

<p>Also, what should I do if subjects appear in more than one survey? </p>

<h1>Updates/Further Elaboration:</h1>

<p>thank you @user30523, here are some more infomation that might be useful:</p>

<p>Suppose I wish to find out the estimated distribution of height across the population using these 5 datasets. </p>

<p>In some data, younger people are oversampled because of the location where the survey are conducted. Let's assume the weights are calculated with respect to their age. </p>

<p>Eg. assuming 2% of the population are 15 years old, and the location of the survey is at a mall where 15-year-olds made up 5% of all shoppers, then sampling weight for an subject aged 15 in that survey would be calculated as 0.02 / 0.05 = 0.4. For simplicity, each person in the mall has equal chance of being surveyed and all participants complied when asked.</p>

<p>Given that 5 surveys are conducted in 5 different malls and each has their set of weights calculated in the same way, how would I then be able to combine all 5 datasets and recalculate the sampling weights?</p>

<p>P.S: I'm new to the topic on sampling weights so do correct me if I have made errors in the way I have calculated the weights.</p>

543,182.0,2,,541.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>As an economist, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is taught and usually understood in relation to linear regression (e.g. in Arthur Goldberger's <em>A Course in Econometrics</em>). Economists/Econometricians typically view ANOVA as uninteresting and prefer to move straight to regression models. From the perspective of linear (or even generalised linear) models, ANOVA assigns coefficients into batches, with each batch corresponding to a ""source of variation"" in ANOVA terminology.</p>

<p>Generally you can replicate the inferences you would obtain from ANOVA using regression but not always OLS regression. Multilevel models are needed for analysing hierarchical data structures such as ""split-plot designs,"" where between-group effects are compared to group-level errors, and within-group effects are compared to data-level errors. <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1214%2F009053604000001048"">Gelman's paper</a> &#91;1&#93; goes into great detail about this problem and effectively argues that ANOVA is an important statistical tool that should still be taught for it's own sake.</p>

<p>In particular Gelman argues that ANOVA is a way of understanding and structuring multilevel models. Therefore ANOVA is not an alternative to regression but as a tool for summarizing complex high-dimensional inferences and for exploratory data analysis. </p>

<p>Gelman is a well-respected statistician and some credence should be given to his view. However, almost all of the empirical work that I do would be equally well served by linear regression and so I firmly fall into the camp of viewing it as a little bit pointless.

If you're agnostic about the form of the relationship (although if the weatherman is any good <em>p(q) - q</em> should be reasonably small), consider using a set of splines for the basis.

<p>I just browsed an article from Larry Winner in the J. Statistics Educ. (2006) which discusses the use of both measures, <a href=""http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v14n3/datasets.winner.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">NASCAR Winston Cup Race Results for 1975-2003</a>.</p>

<p>The key is <em>probably</em> a change in the meaning of your effects when you go from the main-effects-only to the interaction model. What you get for the 'main effects' depends very much on how your treatments and contrasts are coded. In R, the default is treatment contrasts with the first factor levels (the ones with the first names in alphabetical order unless you have gone out of your way to code them differently) as the baseline levels.</p>

<p>Say (for simplicity) that you have two levels, 'control' and 'trt', for each factor. Without the interaction, the meaning of the 'v1.trt' parameter (assuming treatment contrasts as is the default in R) is ""average difference between 'v1.control' and 'v1.trt' group""; the meaning of the 'v2.trt' parameter is ""average difference between 'v2.control' and 'v2.trt'"".</p>

<p>With the interaction, 'v1.trt' is the average difference between 'v1.control' and 'v1.trt' <strong>in the 'v2.control' group</strong>, and similarly 'v2.trt' is the average difference between v2 groups in the 'v1.control' group. Thus, if you have fairly small treatment effects in each of the control groups, but a large effect in the treatment groups, you could easily see what you're seeing.</p>

<p>The only way I can see this happening <em>without</em> a significant interaction term, however, is if all the effects are fairly weak (so that what you really mean by ""the effect disappeared"" is that you went from p=0.06 to p=0.04, across the magic significance line).</p>

<p>Another possibility is that you are 'using up too many degrees of freedom' -- that is, the parameter estimates don't actually change that much, but the residual error term is sufficiently inflated by having to estimate another 4 [ = (2-1)*(5-1)] parameters that your significant terms become non-significant. Again, I would only expect this with a small data set/relatively weak effects.</p>

<p>One possible solution is to move to sum contrasts, although this is also delicate -- you have to be convinced that 'average effect' is meaningful in your case. The very best thing is to plot your data and to look at the coefficients and understand what's happening in terms of the estimated parameters.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Notice that eventually column 5 got full of zeros. This means (as I understand it) that V5 is linearly tied with some of <em>preceeding</em> columns. Which columns? Look at iteration where column 5 is last not full of zeroes - iteration 4. We see there that V5 is tied with V2 and V4 with coefficients -.3333 and .8333: V5 = -.3333*V2+.8333*V4, which corresponds to what we've done with the data: V4 = .4*V2+1.2*V5.</p>

<p>That's how we knew which column is linearly tied with which other. I didn't check how helpful is the above approach in more general case with many groups of interdependancies in the data. In the above example it appeared helpful, though.</p>

Spearman is usually higher by 1/4 to 1/3 and this makes one incorrectly conclude that Spearman is &quot;better&quot; for a particular dataset. The difference between rho and tau is in their ideology, <em>proportion-of-variance</em> for rho and <em>probability</em> for tau. Rho is a usual Pearson r applied for ranked data, and like r, is more sensitive to points with large moments (that is, deviations from cloud centre) than to points with small moments. Therefore <strong>rho is quite sensitive to the shape of the cloud after the ranking</strong> done: the coefficient for an oblong rhombic cloud will be higher than the coefficient for an oblong dumbbelled cloud (because sharp edges of the first are large moments). Tau is an extension of Gamma and is <strong>equally sensitive to all the data points</strong>, so it is less sensitive to peculiarities in shape of the ranked cloud. Tau is more &quot;general&quot; than rho, for rho is warranted only when you believe the underlying (model, or functional in population) relationship between the variables is strictly monotonic. While Tau allows for nonmonotonic underlying curve and measures which monotonic &quot;trend&quot;, positive or negative, prevails there overall. Rho is comparable with r in magnitude; tau is not.</p>

In the case of model selection, generally (but not always) that means some of the parameters equal zero.  If the models are nested, the parameters in the larger model that are not in the smaller model are the ones being tested, with values specified implicitly by their exclusion from the smaller model.  If the models aren't nested, you aren't testing this any more, because BOTH models have parameters that aren't in the other model, so the LR test statistic doesn't have the asymptotic $\chi^2$ distribution that it (usually) does in the nested case.</p>

<p>AIC, on the other hand, is not used for formal testing.  It is used for informal comparisons of models with differing numbers of parameters.

And more importantly when they don't get to the solution, we can be arbitrarily far from it. Problems solved by metaheuristic methods tend to be discrete in nature, because there are far better tools to handle continuous problems. But every now and then you see metaheuristics for continuous problems, too.</p></li>
<li><p>There are numerical optimization methods, people in this community carefully examine the nature of the function that is to be optimized and the restrictions of the solution (into groups like convex optimization,     quadratic programming, linear programming, etc) and apply algorithms  that have been shown to work for that type of function, and those type of restrictions. When people in this area say ""shown to work"" they mean a proof. The situation is that these types of methods work in continuous problems. But when your problem falls in this category, this is definitely the tool to use.</p></li>
<li><p>There are discrete optimization methods, which tend to be things that in nature are connected to algorithms to well studied discrete problems: such as shortest paths, max flow, etc. People in this area also care that their algorithms really work (proofs). There are a subset of people in this group that study really hard problems for which no fast algorithm is expected to exist. They then study approximation algorithms, which are fast algorithms for which they are able to show that their solution is within a constant factor of the true optimum. This is called ""approximation algorithms"". These people also show their results as proofs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So... to answer your question, I do not think that metaheuristics are approximation algorithms. It doesn't seem to me as something connected to opinion, it is just fact.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code># Load package (remember to install.packages(""rms"") or this will fail the first time)
library(rms)

# Get a dataset to experiment with
data(mtcars)
mtcars$am &lt;- factor(mtcars$am, levels=0:1, labels=c(""Automatic"", ""Manual""))

# The rms package needs this work properly
dd &lt;- datadist(mtcars)
options(datadist=""dd"")

# Do the regression
f &lt;- ols(mpg~wt, data=mtcars, x=T, y=T)

# Plot regular mean confidence interval
p &lt;- Predict(f, wt=seq(2.5, 4, by=.001), conf.type=""mean"")
plot(p, ylim=c(10, 30), col=""lightblue"")

# Plot wide confidence interval
p &lt;- Predict(f, wt=seq(2.5, 4, by=.001), conf.type=""individual"")
plot(p, ylim=c(10, 30), col=""lightblue"")
</code></pre>

<p>Gives this output:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UAvh7.png"" alt=""Plain line""></p>

<p>Now usually you want to test the linearity assumption:</p>

<pre><code># Try the model with a restricted cubic spline
f &lt;- ols(mpg~rcs(wt, 3), data=mtcars, x=T, y=T)
anova(f)
</code></pre>

<p>Gives this output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; anova(f)

PCA is applied to the sample just like EFA and CFA.  It simply takes a list of n possibly related factors looks at how the points (samples) scatter in n-dimension space and then gets the first principal component as the linear combination that explains more of the variability in the data than any other linear combination.  Then the second looks at orthogonal directions to the first to find theone out of those that explains the most of the remaining variability and so on with the 3rd and 4th.  So sometimes one can take just 1-3 components to describe most of the variation in the data.

26657,190.0,2,,26070.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Here is a simple toy example illustrating the effect of dimension in a discrimination problem e.g. the problem you face when you want to say if something is observed or if only random effect is observed (this problem is a classic in science). </p>

<p><strong>Heuristic.</strong>  The key issue here is that the Euclidian norm gives the same importance to any direction. This constitutes a lack of prior, and as you certainly know in high dimension there is no free lunch (i.e. if you have no prior idea of what you are searching for, then there is no reason why some noise would not look like what you are searching for, this is tautology ...). </p>

<p>I would say that for any problem there is a limit of information that is necessary to find something else than noise. This limit is related somehow to the ""size"" of the area you are trying to explore with regard to the ""noise"" level (i.e. level of uninformative content). </p>

<p>In high dimension if you have the prior that your signal is sparse then you can remove (i.e. penalize) non sparse vector with a metric that fills the space with sparse vector or by using a thresholding technique. </p>

<p><strong>Framework</strong> Assume that $\xi$ is a gaussian vector with mean $\nu$ and diagonal covariance $\sigma Id$ ($\sigma$ is known) and that you want to test the simple hypothesis </p>

<p>$$H_0: \;\nu=0,\; Vs \; H_{\theta}: \; \nu=\theta $$
(for a given $\theta\in \mathbb{R}^n$) $\theta$ is not necessarily known in advance. </p>

<p><strong>Test statistic with energy</strong>. The intuition you certainly have is that it is a good idea to evaluate the norm/energy $\mathcal{E}_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\xi_i^2$ of you observation $\xi$ to build a test statistic.  Actually you can construct a standardized centered (under $H_0$) version $T_n$ of the energy $T_n=\frac{\sum_i\xi_i^2-\sigma^2}{\sqrt{2n\sigma^4}}$. That makes a critical region at level $\alpha$ of the form $\{T_n\geq v_{1-\alpha}\}$ for a well chosen $v_{1-\alpha}$</p>

<p><strong>Power of the test and dimension.</strong> In this case it is an easy probability exercise to show the following formula for the power of your test: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$$P_{\theta}(T\leq v_{1-\alpha})=P\left (Z\leq \frac{v_{1-\alpha}}{\sqrt{1+2\|\theta\|_2^2/(n\sigma^2)}}-\frac{\|\theta\|^2_2}{\sqrt{2n\sigma^4+2\sigma^2\|\theta\|_2^2/(n\sigma^2)}}\right )$$
  with $Z$ a sum of $n$ iid random variables with $\mathbb{E}[Z]=0$ and $Var(Z)=1$. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the power of your test is increased by the energy of your signal $\|\theta\|^2_2$ and decreased by $n$. Practically speaking this means that when you increase the size $n$ of your problem if it does not increase the strength of the signal at the same time then you are adding uninformative information to your observation (or you are reducing the proportion of useful information in the information you have): this is like adding noise and reduces the power of the test (i.e. it is more likely that you are gonna say nothing is observed while there is actually something). </p>

<p><strong>Toward a test with a threshold statistic.</strong> If you do not have much energy in your signal but if you know a linear transformation that can help you to have this energy concentrated in a small part of your signal, then you can build a test statistic that will only evaluate the energy for the small part of your signal. If you known in advance where it is concentrated (for example you known there cannot be high frequencies in your signal) then you can obtain a power in the preceding test with $n$ replaced by a small number and $\|\theta\|^2_2$ almost the same... If you do not know it in advance you have to estimate it this leads to well known thresholding tests. </p>

I believe this shows up especially in theoretical literature where the second form, ""square,"" appears more often (I believe: I haven't systematically checked).</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>As @gung surmised, <code>abline(v=mean...</code> was used to draw the mean-line across the plot and <code>rug</code> was used to draw the data values (though I actually used <code>rug(jitter(...</code> because the data was rounded to integers).</p>

<p>Here's a way to do the boxplot in between the histogram and the axis: </p>

<pre><code>hist(Davis2[,2],n=30)
boxplot(Davis2[,2],
  add=TRUE,horizontal=TRUE,at=-0.75,border=""darkred"",boxwex=1.5,outline=FALSE)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not going to list what everything there is for, but you can check the arguments in the help (<code>?boxplot</code>) to find out what they're for, and play with them yourself.</p>

<p>However, it's not a general solution - I don't guarantee it will always work as well as it does here (note I already changed the <code>at</code> and <code>boxwex</code> options*). If you don't write an intelligent function to take care of everything, it's necessary to pay attention to what everything does to make sure it's doing what you want.</p>

<p>Here's how to create the data I used (I was trying to show how Theil regression was really able to handle several influential outliers). It just happened to be data I was playing with when I first answered this question.</p>

<pre><code> library(""car"")
 add &lt;- data.frame(sex=c(""F"",""F""),
       weight=c(150,130),height=c(NA,NA),repwt=c(55,50),repht=c(NA,NA))
 Davis2 &lt;- rbind(Davis,add)
</code></pre>

<p>* -- an appropriate value for <code>at</code> is around -0.5 times the value of <code>boxwex</code>; that would be a good default if you write a function to do it; <code>boxwex</code> would need to  be scaled in a way that relates to the y-scale (height) of the boxplot; I'd suggest 0.04 to 0.05 times the upper y-limit might often be okay.</p>

Probably, you have heard the saying &quot;correlation isn't causation.&quot;  You have essentially defined causality as correlation.  The problem is worse than that, though.  Causality is not a statistical or probabilistic concept at all, at least as those topics are normally taught.  There is no statistical or probabilistic definition of causality: nothing involving conditional expectations or conditional distributions or suchlike.  It is hard to pick up this fact from courses in statistics or econometrics, though.</p>

<p>By construction, your <em>error cost function</em> is $\left[Y-g(X)\right]^2$. This incorporates a critical assumption (that the error cost function is symmetric around zero) -a different error cost function would not necessarily have the conditional expected value as the $\arg \min$ of its expected value.
You cannot minimize your error cost function because it contains unknown quantities. So you decide to minimize its expected value instead. Then your objective function becomes</p>

<p>$$E\left[Y-g(X)\right]^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[y-g(X)\right]^2f_{Y|X}(y|x)dy $$</p>

<p>which I believe answers also your second question. It is intuitive that the expected value will be of $Y$ conditional on $X$, since we are trying to estimate/forecast $Y$ based on $X$. Decompose the square to obtain</p>

<p>$$E\left[Y-g(X)\right]^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}y^2f_{Y|X}(y|x)dy  -2g(X)\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}yf_{Y|X}(y|x)dy \\+ \Big[g(X)\Big]^2\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{Y|X}(y|x)dy$$</p>

<p>The first term does not contain $g(X)$ so it does not affect minimization, and it can be ignored. The integral in the second term equals the conditional expected value of $Y$ given $X$, and the integral in the last term equals unity. So </p>

<p>$$\arg \min_{g(x)} E\left[Y-g(X)\right]^2 = \arg \min_{g(x)} \Big\{ -2g(X)E(Y\mid X) + \Big[g(X)\Big]^2 \Big\}$$</p>

<p>The first derivative w.r.t $g(X)$ is $-2E(Y\mid X) + 2g(X)$ leading to the first order condition for minimization $g(X) = E(Y\mid X)$ while the second derivative is equal to $2&gt;0$ which is sufficient for a minimum.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM:The logic of the ""add and subtract"" proof approach.</strong>  </p>

<p>The OP is puzzled by the approach stated in the question, because it seems tautological. It isn't, because while using the tactic of adding and subtracting makes a <em>specific part</em> of the objective function zero for an arbitrary choice of the term that is added and subtracted, it does NOT equalize the <em>value function</em> , namely the value of the objective function evaluated at the candidate minimizer.</p>

<p>For the choice $g(X) = E(Y \mid X)$ we have the value function $ V\left(E(Y\mid X)\right) = E\Big[ (Y-E(Y \mid X))^2\mid X\Big]$
For the arbitrary choice $g(X) = h(X)$we have the value funtion $ V\left(h(X)\right) = E\Big[ (Y-h(X))^2\mid X\Big]$.</p>

<p>I claim that </p>

<p>$$V\left(E(Y\mid X)\right) \le V\left(h(X)\right)$$
$$\Rightarrow E(Y^2\mid X) -2E\Big [(YE(Y \mid X))\mid X\Big] + E\Big [(E(Y \mid X))^2\mid X\Big] \\\le E(Y^2\mid X) -2E\Big [(Yh(X))\mid X\Big] + E\Big [(h(X))^2\mid X\Big]$$</p>

<p>The first term of the LHS and the RHS cancel out. Also note that the outer expectation is conditional on $X$. By the properties of conditional expectations we end up with</p>

<p>$$...\Rightarrow  -2E(Y \mid X)\cdot E\Big (Y\mid X\Big) + \Big [E(Y \mid X)\Big]^2 \le  -2E(Y\mid X)h(X) + \Big [h(X)\Big]^2$$</p>

<p>$$\Rightarrow  0 \le  \Big [E(Y \mid X)\Big]^2-2E(Y\mid X)h(X) + \Big [h(X)\Big]^2$$</p>

<p>$$\Rightarrow  0 \le  \Big [E(Y \mid X) - h(x)\Big]^2$$
which holds with strict inequality if $h(x) \neq E(Y \mid X)$. So $E(Y \mid X)$ is the global and unique minimizer.</p>

<p>But this also says that the ""add-and-subtract"" approach is not the most illuminating way of proof here.</p>

56860,155.0,2,,56859.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Coming from a behavioural sciences background, I associate this terminology particularly with introductory statistics textbooks. In this context the distinction is that :</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong>  are functions of  the sample data that are intrinsically interesting in describing some feature of the data. Classic descriptive statistics include mean, min, max, standard deviation, median, skew, kurtosis.</li>
<li><strong>Inferential statistics</strong> are a function of the sample data that assists you to draw an inference regarding an hypothesis about a population parameter. Classic inferential statistics include z, t, $\chi^2$, F-ratio, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The important point is that any statistic, inferential or descriptive, is a function of the sample data. A parameter is a function of the population, where the term population is the same as saying the underlying data generating process.</p>

<p>From this perspective the status of a given function of the data as a descriptive or inferential statistic depends on the purpose for which you are using it. </p>

<p>That said, some statistics are clearly more useful in describing  relevant features of the data, and some are well suited to aiding inference. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Inferential statistics:</strong>  Standard test statistics like t and z, for a given data generating process, where the null hypothesis is false, the expected value is strongly influenced by sample size. Most researchers would not see such statistics as estimating a population parameter of intrinsic interest.</li>
<li><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong>: In contrast descriptive statistics do estimate population parameters that are typically of intrinsic interest. For example the sample mean and standard deviation provide estimates of the equivalent population parameters. Even descriptive statistics like the minimum and maximum provide information about equivalent or similar population parameters, although of course in this case, much more care is required. Furthermore, many descriptive statistics might be biased or otherwise less than ideal estimators. However, they still have some utility in estimating a population parameter of interest.</li>
</ul>

<p>So from this perspective, the important things to understand are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>statistic</strong>: function of the sample data</li>
<li><strong>parameter</strong>: function of the population (data generating process)</li>
<li><strong>estimator</strong>: function of the sample data used to provide an estimate of a parameter</li>
<li><strong>inference</strong>: process of reaching a conclusion about a parameter</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, you could either define the distinction between descriptive and inferential based on the intention of the researcher using the statistic, or you could define a statistic based on how it is typically used.</p>

57177,594.0,2,,57164.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>As for qualitative differences, the lognormal and gamma are, as you say, quite similar.</p>
<p>Indeed, in practice they're often used to model the same phenomena (some people will use a gamma where others use a lognormal). They are both, for example, constant-coefficient-of-variation models (the CV for the lognormal is <span class=""math-container"">$\sqrt{e^{\sigma^2} -1}$</span>, for the gamma it's <span class=""math-container"">$1/\sqrt \alpha$</span>).</p>
<p>[How can it be constant if it depends on a parameter, you ask? It applies when you model the scale (location for the log scale); for the lognormal, the <span class=""math-container"">$\mu$</span> parameter acts as the log of a scale parameter, while for the gamma, the scale is the parameter that isn't the shape parameter (or its reciprocal if you use the shape-rate parameterization). I'll call the scale parameter for the gamma distribution <span class=""math-container"">$\beta$</span>. Gamma GLMs model the mean (<span class=""math-container"">$\mu=\alpha\beta$</span>) while holding <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span> constant; in that case <span class=""math-container"">$\mu$</span> is also a scale parameter. A model with varying <span class=""math-container"">$\mu$</span> and constant <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span> or <span class=""math-container"">$\sigma$</span> respectively will have constant CV.]</p>
<p>You might find it instructive to look at the density of their <em>logs</em>, which often shows a very clear difference.</p>
<p>The log of a lognormal random variable is ... normal. It's symmetric.</p>
<p>The log of a gamma random variable is left-skew. Depending on the value of the shape parameter, it may be quite skew or nearly symmetric.</p>
<p>Here's an example, with both lognormal and gamma having mean 1 and variance 1/4. The top plot shows the densities (gamma in green, lognormal in blue), and the lower one shows the densities of the logs:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I9ARM.png"" alt=""gamma and lognormal, densitiy and density of log"" /></p>
<p>(Plotting the log of the density of the logs is also useful. That is, taking a log-scale on the y-axis above)</p>
<p>This difference implies that the gamma has more of a tail on the left, and less of a tail on the right; the far right tail of the lognormal is heavier and its left tail lighter. And indeed, if you look at the skewness, of the lognormal and gamma, for a given coefficient of variation, the lognormal is more right skew (<span class=""math-container"">$\text{CV}^3+3\text{CV}$</span>) than the gamma (<span class=""math-container"">$2\text{CV}$</span>).</p>

59372,668.0,2,,58770.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>A <em>formula</em> is requested.  Unfortunately, the situation is so complicated it appears that any formula will merely be a roundabout way of enumerating all the possibilities.  Instead, this answer offers an <em>algorithm</em> which is (a) tantamount to a formula involving sums of products of binomial coefficients and (b) can be ported to many platforms.</p>

<hr>

<p>To obtain such a formula, <strong>break down the possibilities into mutually disjoint groups</strong> in two ways: according to how many letters <em>not</em> in the word are selected in the rack (let this be $m$) and according to how many wildcards (blanks) are selected (let this be $w$).  When there are $r=7$ tiles in the rack, $N$ available tiles, $M$ available tiles with letters not in the word, and $W=2$ blanks available, the number of possible choices given by $(m,w)$ is</p>

<p>$$\binom{M}{m}\binom{W}{w}\binom{N-M-W}{r-m-w}$$</p>

<p>because the choices of non-word letters, blanks, and word letters are independent conditional on $(m,w,r).$</p>

<p><strong>This reduces the problem to finding the number of ways to spell a word when selecting only from the tiles representing the word's letters,</strong> <em>given</em> that $w$ blanks are available and $r-m-w$ tiles will be selected.  The situation is messy and no closed formula seems available.  For instance, with $w=0$ blanks and $m=3$ out-of-word letters are drawn there will be precisely four letters left to spell ""boot"" that were drawn from the ""b"", ""o"", and ""t"" tiles.  Given there are $2$ ""b""'s, $8$ ""o""'s, and $6$ ""t""'s in the Scrabble tile set, there are positive probabilities of drawing (multisets) ""bboo"", ""bbot"", ""bbtt"", ""booo"", ""boot"", ""bott"", ""bttt"", ""oooo"", ""ooot"", ""oott"", ""ottt"", and ""tttt"", but only one of these spells ""boot"".  And that was the easy case!  For example, supposing the rack contains five tiles chosen randomly from the ""o"", ""b"", and ""t"" tiles, together with both blanks, there are many more ways to spell ""boot""--and not to spell it.  For instance, ""boot"" can be spelled from ""__boott"" and ""__bbttt"", but not from ""__ttttt"".</p>

<p><strong>This counting--the heart of the problem--can be handled recursively.</strong>  I will describe it with an example.  Suppose we wish to count the ways of spelling ""boot"" with one blank and four more tiles from the collection of ""b"", ""o"", and ""t"" tiles (whence the remaining two tiles show non-blank letters not in {""b"", ""o"", ""t""}).  Consider the first letter, ""b"":</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A ""b"" can be drawn in $\binom{2}{1}$ ways from the two ""b"" tiles available.  This reduces the problem to counting the number of ways of spelling the suffix ""oot"" using both blanks and just three more tiles from the collection of ""o"" and ""t"" tiles.</p></li>
<li><p>One blank can be designated as a ""b"".  This reduces the problem to counting the number of ways of spelling ""oot"" using the remaining blank and just three more tiles from the collection of ""o"" and ""t"" tiles.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In general, steps (1) and (2)--which are disjoint and therefore contribute additively to the probability calculations--can be implemented as a loop over the possible number of blanks that might be used for the first letter.  The reduced problem is solved recursively.  The base case occurs when there's one letter left, there is a certain number of tiles with that letter available, and there may be some blanks in the rack, too.  We only have to make sure that the number of blanks in the rack plus the number of available tiles will be enough to obtain the desired quantity of that last letter.</p>

<p>Here is <code>R</code> code for the recursive step.  <code>rack</code> usually equals $7$, <code>word</code> is an array of counts of the letters (such as <code>c(b=1, o=2, t=1)</code>), <code>alphabet</code> is a similar structure giving the numbers of available tiles with those letters, and <code>wild</code> is the number of blanks assumed to occur in the rack.</p>

<pre class=""lang-r prettyprint-override""><code>f &lt;- function(rack, word, alphabet, wild) {
  if (length(word) == 1) {
    return(ifelse(word &gt; rack+wild, 0, choose(alphabet, rack)))

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Here is a different perspective. In this case we take the theory of % correct prediction of complications >50% as the null hypothesis. So using the significance testing logic we would choose to study the imaging technique more if it is not significant, but not use it if the result is significant. Here we are attempting to disprove the research hypothesis rather than the opposite as was done above (although the original way using reverse logic is the common approach for some strange reason).</p>

For concreteness, suppose the data is daily and <span class=""math-container"">$T$</span> corresponds to today.</p>
<p>In-sample analysis means to estimate the model using all available data up to and including <span class=""math-container"">$T$</span>, and then compare the model's fitted values to the actual realizations. However, this procedure is known to draw an overly optimistic picture of the model's forecasting ability, since common fitting algorithms (e.g. using squared error or likelihood criteria) tend to take pains to avoid large prediction errors, and are thus susceptible to overfitting - mistaking noise for signal in the data.</p>
<p>A true out-of-sample analysis would be to estimate the model based on data up to and including today, construct a forecast of tomorrow's value <span class=""math-container"">$Y_{T+1}$</span>, wait until tomorrow, record the forecast error <span class=""math-container"">$e_{T+1} \equiv Y_{T+1} - \hat f(X_{T+1-h}),$</span> re-estimate the model, make a new forecast of <span class=""math-container"">$Y_{T+2}$</span>, and so forth. At the end of this exercise, one would have a sample of forecast errors <span class=""math-container"">$\{e_{T+l}\}_{l=1}^L$</span> which would be truly out-of-sample and would give a very realistic picture of the model's performance.</p>
<p>Since this procedure is very time-consuming, people often resort to &quot;pseudo&quot;, or &quot;simulated&quot;, out-of-sample analysis, which means to mimic the procedure described in the last paragraph, using some historical date <span class=""math-container"">$T_0 &lt; T$</span>, rather than today's date <span class=""math-container"">$T$</span>, as a starting point. The resulting forecasting errors <span class=""math-container"">$\{e_t\}_{t=T_0+1}^T$</span> are then used to get an estimate of the model's out-of-sample forecasting ability.</p>

61392,2958.0,2,,59134.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think the problem is that you train (or rather: optimize) using your ""test"" set. In other words, you can do this, but then you need an additional independent test set for the final validation. Or a nested validation set up from the beginning.</p>

<p>This is how I see the problem:</p>

<p>There can be combinations of training and test data (particular splits), where the model trained on that training data works well with the given test set -- regardless of how representative the test set is for the actual problem. Your strategy is actually a search strategy that tries to find such combinations. As there is no guarantee that you'll encounter a really satisfactory model before encountering one of the ""fake satisfactory"" models, there is trouble lurking. </p>

<p>Because you decide <em>depending on the test set performance</em> whether to go on for a new model or not, your testing is not independent. I think this is related to the problems with other iterative model optimization approaches, where an increase in model quality seems to occur also between equivalent models.</p>

<p>Here's a simulation:</p>

<ul>
<li>multivariate normally distributed data, sd = 1 for 25 variates, first 4 informative being 0 for one class and 1 for the other. </li>
<li>500 cases of each class in the data set, split 80:20 randomly without replacement into train and ""test"" sets.  </li>
<li>50000 cases each class independent test set.</li>
<li>repeat until ""acceptable"" accuracy of 90% is reached according to internal test set.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DgI0s.png"" alt=""enter image description here""><br>
circles: internal test estimate, dots and whiskers: external independent test set with 95% ci (Agresti-Coull method), red line: cumulative maximum of internal estimate. </p>

<p>Your rule basically uses the cumulative maximum of the internal test set. In the example that means that within few iterations, you end up with an optimistic bias that claims 1/3 less errors than your models actually have. Note that the models here cannot be distinguished with a 200 cases test set. The order of differences between the large external test set results is the same as the confidence interval width.<br>
You can also nicely see what I mean with <em>skimming variance</em>: the internal test set estimate itself is unbiased. What causes the bias is doing (potentially large) numbers of iterations and picking the maximum. </p>

<p>Besides the optimization that is hidden in this procedure as well, the problem is of course the large variance of the accuracy. Other performance measures like Brier's score have lower variance and thus do not lead to such serious overfitting that fast. </p>

66211,668.0,2,,58203.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>You are correct: there are serious problems with the sampling procedures described in <a href=""http://ocw.jhsph.edu/courses/statmethodsforsamplesurveys/PDFs/Lecture2.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">that reference</a>.  Its description of how systematic sampling should be carried out is plainly wrong, but the problems can be fixed.</p>

<p>We are talking about systematic sampling of a population of $N$ sampling units.  They have been indexed with $1, 2, \ldots, N$ beforehand.  Systematic sampling selects a desired number $n$ of individuals in the population by taking them at relatively regular intervals within this set of indexes.</p>

<p>The three methods in the reference begin by choosing the nominal sampling interval $k$ either to be $N/n$ (potentially non-integral), $\lceil N/n \rceil$ (rounding up), or $\lfloor N/n \rfloor$ (rounding down).  Starting at a random integer $r$ chosen uniformly from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, \lfloor k \rfloor\}$ they select the units at indexes $r, [r + k], [r + 2k], \ldots, [r + (n-1)k],$ where ""$[x]$"" means to round $x$ to an integer according to some definite rule if $x$ is not integral.  These indexes are taken modulo $N$ if necessary, circling back to the beginning if the sequence goes beyond $N$.</p>

<p>To see more clearly what can happen, let's consider a small population of, say, $N=7$ from which we wish to obtain a sample of size $n=3.$ </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using $k = N/n = 7/3$, the possible starting indexes are $r=1$ and $r=2$.  In the first case the selected indexes would be $1, [1+7/3], [1+2*7/3]$ = $1, 3, 6$ and in the second case the indexes would be $2, [2+7/3], [2+2*7/3]$ = $2, 4, 7$.  We can picture these two samples--both equally likely to be chosen--by drawing marks below the selected indexes thus:</p>

<pre><code>Sample   1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   r=1   *   *     *
   r=2     *   *     *
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Using $k = \lceil 7/3 \rceil = 3$ gives three possible samples, each with a chance of $1/3$ of being chosen:</p>

<pre><code>Sample   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
   r=1   *     *     *
   r=2   * *     *   
   r=3     * *     *
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how in the second and third samples indexes of $8$ and $9$ were calculated and wrapped around modulo $7$ to the beginning, turning into $1$ and $2$, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Using $k = \lfloor 7/3 \rfloor = 2$ gives two possible samples, each with a chance of $1/2$ of being chosen:</p>

<pre><code>Sample   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
   r=1   *   *   *
   r=2     *   *   *
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The problems pointed out in the question are apparent:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In case 1, index $5$ is in neither possible sample and therefore is never selected.</p></li>
<li><p>In case 2, indexes $1$ and $2$ each have a $2/3$ chance of being in the sample (because they each appear in two out of the three equally likely samples) while the other indexes have only a $1/3$ chance of being in the sample.  Thus this sampling method is biased towards the first two subjects in the list.</p></li>
<li><p>In case 3, index $7$ is never selected.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, for larger $N$ a certain fraction of the population will either never be selected (as in cases 1 and 3) or the <em>initial</em> subjects in the list will have relatively high chances of being selected (case 2).  In case 3, the <em>final</em> subjects in the list will never be selected, while in case 1 the non-selected subjects are situated fairly evenly throughout the list.</p>

<p>Normally, systematic sampling is used because there is a natural ordering of the subjects that is related to how they can be sampled: their indexes correspond to their time of enrollment in a human trial or are positions of possible samples in a physical medium or process (like soils in a streambed or products coming off an assembly line).  Therefore the problems in cases 1 and 2 are <em>serious</em> ones, because they systematically omit or over-weight one end of the population, whose properties easily could differ from those of the rest of the population.  <strong>Any study using these methods would thereby be seriously flawed.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There are two solutions.</strong>  The simplest one is straightforward and is the <em>correct</em> way to conduct such sampling: choose $r$ uniformly at random from the <em>entire</em> list of indexes, not just the first $k$ of them.  For instance, here are all the equally-likely samples that can be obtained using the first (round-as-you-go) method.  The first two already appeared in (1) above:</p>

<pre><code>Sample   1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   r=1   *   *     *
   r=2     *   *     *
   r=3   *   *   *  
   r=4     *   *   *
   r=5       *   *   *
   r=6   *     *   *
   r=7     *     *   *
</code></pre>

<p>By looking down the columns it is easy to see that each index has $3/7$ chance of appearing in the sample: there is no longer any bias.</p>

<p>It is worth reflecting on how such a subtle change--choosing the initial index randomly from $1, \ldots, N$ rather than $1, \ldots, k$--can have a profound effect on the quality of the study.</p>

<p><strong>The other solution</strong> is to compensate for the sampling bias using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horvitz%E2%80%93Thompson_estimator"" rel=""noreferrer"">Horvitz-Thompson estimator</a>.  This adjusts for varying probabilities of inclusion in the sample.  In method (1) it would effectively recognize that the samples are only from the subpopulation indexed by $1,2,3,4,6,7$ (skipping $5$, which is never included). This wouldn't really fix much, but it would highlight the shortcomings of the results and perhaps prevent invalid inferences.</p>

<p>In method (2) the H-T estimator would give any observations from indexes $1$ and $2$ a weight of just one-half the weights of the other indexes.  For example, if the sample happened to be $r=3$ then subjects $2, 3,$ and $6$ would be drawn.  Let the values of some quantity observed for these subjects be written $x_2, x_3,$ and $x_6,$ respectively.  Because the chance of including $2$ in the sample <em>a priori</em> was $2/3$ and the chances of including $3$ or $6$ were only $1/3,$ the Horvitz-Thompson estimator of the population mean would be </p>

<p>$$\frac{\frac{1}{2/3} x_2 + \frac{1}{1/3} x_3 + \frac{1}{1/3} x_6}{\frac{1}{2/3}  + \frac{1}{1/3}  + \frac{1}{1/3}} =\frac{\frac{1}{2} x_2 + x_3 + x_6}{\frac{1}{2} + 1 + 1} = \frac{1}{5}x_2 + \frac{2}{5} x_3 + \frac{2}{5} x_6.$$</p>

<p>There are comparable formulas for the sampling variance of this estimate (used to construct confidence intervals and test hypotheses, for instance).</p>

<p>The Horvitz-Thompson estimator comes to the fore when it is impossible to avoid over- and under-weighting some subjects in a sample.  It can also be applied to rescue a study that was otherwise ruined using the procedures in the reference: after the fact, if we can compute the actual probability of each subject's inclusion in the sample, then we can apply these probabilities to obtain valid estimates and valid hypothesis tests.</p>

<p>The coefficients $\lambda_U$ and $\lambda_L$ are defined in terms of quantile exceedences.
For the upper tail dependence coefficient $\lambda_U$ one looks at the probability that $Y$ exceeds the $u$-quantile $G^{-1}(u)$, given that $X$ exceeds the $u$-quantile $F^{-1}(u)$, and then consider the limit as $u$ goes to $1$, provided it exists.
Large values of $\lambda_U$ imply that joint extremes are more likely than for low values of $\lambda_U$. Interpretation for the lower tail dependence coefficient $\lambda_L$ is analogous.</p>

<p>If $\lambda_U = 0$, then $X$ and $Y$ are said to be <em>asymptotically independent</em>; if $\lambda_U \in (0, 1]$ they are <em>asymptotically dependent</em>.
For independent variables $\lambda_U = 0$; for perfectly dependent variables $\lambda_U = 0$. Note that $\lambda_U = 0$ does NOT imply independence; the comment/statement in the question's reference is wrong. Indeed, consider a bivariate normal distribution with correlation $\rho \notin \{0, 1\}$. Then, one can show that $\lambda_U = 0$ but the variables are dependent.</p>

<p>A distribution with, say, $\lambda_U = 0.5$ does not mean that there is a linear dependence between $X$ and $Y$; it means that $X$ and $Y$ are asymptotically dependent in the upper tail, and the strength of the dependence is 0.5.

<p>The reason is because most businesses (I believe) hold a reasonably large portion of coins in stock and will only distribute the coins which most efficiently lead to correct change.  Thus even if you go into the same store 100 times and collect change each time unless you have exhausted the stock of available coins, the coins that you receive in exchange for your sampling will only be those which correspond only with the least change required to fulfill your needs.</p>

<p>Assuming you draw change requirements uniformly between 1 cent and 499 cents this ratio is:</p>

<pre><code>       200        100         25         10          5          1

</code></pre>

<p>If the store has no shortage of coins then your sampling procedure will automatically return the above ratios which have no correlation between the specific samples and the greater population of coins in circulation.  To see how I came up with these numbers see my <a href=""http://www.econometricsbysimulation.com/2014/07/estimating-required-change.html"" rel=""nofollow"">blog post</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>But this does not account for the oddities of prices which tend to cluster ending in .09 as in .99, .49, or .39 (in the US at least) which will definitely contribute to higher ratio of pennies required for many purchases than in the uniform draw of change.  Purchase requirements would need be specified so as to not cause further contamination of the data.  Overall, I think it is clear that this is a pretty problematic study design.</p>

<p>If you were forced to do something like this then you might be alt to 1. record change totals for each purchase, 2. calculating efficient coinage selection via the method I propose on my blog for each purchase, 3. record coins actually returned, 4. estimate the different between the optimal returned coin quantities and that actually returned to estimate to what degree coin stocks might be diverging from the optimal quantities.  From there I am not sure what to do with it in order to estimate total coins available in the currency.</p>

85707,36513.0,2,,55361.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I'm first outlining an approach for two companies in detail, the extension to even more companies then should be intuitive (at least for the likelihood, the prior could be more tricky).</p>

<p>Imagine there are two companies <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, where <em>A</em> has $N_A$ locomotives and <em>B</em> has $N_B$ locomotives.  We assume $N_A \ge N_B$ (you can always switch <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> to make this hold).  The total number for that hypothesis of locomotives is $N_{tot} = N_A + N_B$.</p>

<p>Imagine you see a locomotive with the number $n$.  There are three cases for the likelihood:</p>

<ol>
<li>$N_A &lt; n$: This can't happen, so the likelihood is zero.</li>
<li>$N_B &lt; n \le N_A$: This locomotive must come from company <em>A</em>, so there is only one locomotive with this number.  Thus the likelihood is $1/N_{tot}$</li>
<li>$n \le N_B$: This locomotive can be either from <em>A</em> or from <em>B</em>, so there are two locomotives with this number.  The likelihood to see one of them is $2/N_{tot}$.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a quick sanity check: The likelihood to see any number at all is $$\sum_{i=1}^\infty L(i) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_B} \frac{2}{N_{tot}} + \sum_{i=N_B+1}^{N_A} \frac{1}{N_{tot}} \\ = \frac{2\cdot N_B}{N_{tot}} + \frac{N_A-N_B}{N_{tot}} = \frac{N_A+N_B}{N_{tot}} = 1$$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Generally, there will be (number of companies + 1) cases, one for each interval $N_i &lt; n \le N_{i+1}$.  Luckily, we can look at the problem from a different angle and see that what we need for the likelihood are actually just two numbers: $N_{tot}$, the total number of locomotives; and $N_n$, the number of locomotives that have the number $n$.  How likely are we to see one of the $N_n$ locomotive, out of $N_{tot}$ locomotives?  This will happen in $\frac{N_n}{N_{tot}}$ of all cases, so this fraction is the likelihood.
In Python, you can calculate this with two sum generators (and you don't even have to order the companies by size).  If <code>Ns</code> contains a list (or tuple) of company sizes according to your hypothesis, then this will give the likelihood for seeing a locomotive with number <code>n</code>:</p>

<pre><code>total_number_of_locomotives = sum(N for N in Ns)
number_of_locomotives_with_that_number = sum(1 for N in Ns if n&lt;=N)
likelihood = (number_of_locomotives_with_that_number / total_number_of_locomotives)
</code></pre>

85831,37646.0,2,,57779.0,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>This is the simplest proof I've been able to find.  </p>

<p>Just by rearranging factorials, we can rewrite the hypergeometric probability function as<br>
$$ \mathrm{Prob}(X=x) = \frac{1}{x!} \cdot \dfrac{M^{(x)} \, K^{(x)}}{N^{(x)}} \cdot \dfrac{(N-K)^{(M-x)}}{(N-x)^{(M-x)}}, $$
where $a^{(b)}$ is the falling power $a(a-1)\cdots(a-b+1)$.
Since $x$ is fixed, 
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{M^{(x)} \, K^{(x)}}{N^{(x)}} 
&amp;= \prod_{j=0}^{x-1} \dfrac{(M-j) \cdot (K-j)}{(N-j)}  \\
&amp;= \prod_{j=0}^{x-1} \left( \dfrac{MK}{n} \right) \cdot \dfrac{(1-j/M) \cdot (1-j/K)}{(1-j/N)} \\
&amp;= \left( \dfrac{MK}{N} \right) ^x \; \prod_{j=0}^{x-1} \dfrac{(1-j/M) \cdot (1-j/K)}{(1-j/N)},
\end{align*}
which $\to \lambda^x$ as $N$, $K$ and $M$ $\to \infty$ with $\frac{MK}{N} = \lambda$.</p>

<p>Lets replace $N-x$, $K-x$ and $M-x$ by new variables $n$, $k$ and $m$ for simplicity.  Since $x$ is fixed, as $N,K,M \to \infty$ with $KM/N \to \lambda$, so too $n,k,m \to \infty$ with $nk/m \to \lambda$.  Next we write 
$$ A = \dfrac{(N-K)^{(M-x)}}{(N-x)^{(M-x)}} = \dfrac{(n-k)^{(m)} }{(n)^{(m)}} = \prod_{j=0}^{m-1} \left( \dfrac{n-j-k}{n-j} \right)= \prod_{j=0}^{m-1} \left( 1 - \dfrac{k}{n-j} \right)$$ 
and take logs:
$$ \ln \, A = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \ln  \left( 1 - \dfrac{k}{n-j} \right).  $$ 
Since the bracketed quantity is an increasing function of $j$ we have
$$ \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \ln  \left( 1 - \dfrac{k}{n} \right) \le \ln \, A \le \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \ln  \left( 1 - \dfrac{k}{n-m+1} \right), $$
or
$$ m \, \ln  \left( 1 - \dfrac{k}{n} \right) \le \ln \, A \le m \, \ln  \left( 1 - \dfrac{k}{n-m+1} \right). $$
But $\ln (1-x) &lt; -x$ for $0 &lt; x &lt; 1$, so 
$$ m \, \ln  \left( 1 - \dfrac{k}{n} \right) \le \ln \, A &lt; -m \, \left( \dfrac{k}{n-m+1} \right), $$
and dividing through by $km/n$ gives
$$ \frac{n}{k} \, \ln  \left( 1 - \dfrac{k}{n} \right) \le \dfrac{\ln \, A}{km/n} &lt; - \, \left( \dfrac{n}{n-m+1} \right) = - \, \left( \dfrac{1}{1-m/n+1/n} \right). $$
Finally, we let $k$, $m$ and $n$ tend to infinity in such a way that $km/n \to \lambda$.  Since both $k/n \to 0$ and $m/n \to 0$, both the left and right bounds $\to -1$.  (The left bound follows from $\lim_{n \to \infty} (1-1/n)^n = e^{-1}$, which is a famous limit in calculus.)  So by the Squeeze Theorem we have $\ln \, A \to -\lambda$, and thus $A \to e^{-\lambda}$.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, when we use the normal distribution to calculate p-values for each test, then these p-values do not take multiple testing into account. To correct for it and control the family-wise error rate, we need some adjustments. Bonferonni, i.e. dividing the significance level or multiplying the raw p-values by the number of tests, is only one possible correction. There are a large number of other multiple testing p-value corrections that are in many cases less conservative.</p>

<p>These p-value corrections do not take the specific structure of the hypothesis tests into account.</p>

<p>I am more familiar with the pairwise comparison of the original data instead of the rank transformed data as in Kruskal-Wallis or Friedman tests. In that case, which is the Tukey HSD test, the test statistic for the multiple comparison is distributed according to the studentized range distribution, which is the distribution for all pairwise comparisons under the assumption of independent samples. It is based on probabilities of multivariate normal distribution which could be calculated by numerical integration but are usually used from tables.</p>

<p>My guess, since I don't know the theory, is that the studentized range distribution can be applied to the case of rank tests in a similar way as in the Tukey HSD pairwise comparisons.</p>

<p>So, using (2) normal distribution plus multiple testing p-value corrections and using (1) studentized range distributions are two different ways of getting an approximate distribution of the test statistics. However, if the assumptions for the use of the studentized range distribution are satisfied, then it should provide a better approximation since it is designed for the specific problem of all pairwise comparisons.</p>

(That's assuming there are no instances of identical X's producing different Y's, but that almost surely won't happen with continuous data.)  When you fit so tightly, if actually harms predictive ability, b/c there is a lot of spurious complexity in the prediction function, so my guess is that gamma=0.02 will outperform out-of-sample, while gamma=0.042 will dominate in-sample. If you're interested in prediction, go with 0.02. There aren't many reasons to go with in-sample performance, but there are instances when you want to be a little liberal with the cost and gamma parameters.

First, you explain it to your great-grandmother; then to your grandmother; then to your mother; then to your spouse; finally, to your daughter (a mathematician). Each time the next person is less of a layman. Here is how the conversation might go.</em></p>
<p><strong>Great-grandmother: I heard you are studying &quot;Pee-See-Ay&quot;. I wonder what that is...</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> Ah, it's just a method of summarizing some data. Look, we have some wine bottles standing here on the table. We can describe each wine by its colour, how strong it is, how old it is, and so on.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zfB1L.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zfB1L.jpg"" alt=""Color of Wine Chart"" /></a>
<em>Visualization originally found</em> <a href=""http://winefolly.com/tutorial/wine-color-chart/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<p>We can compose a whole list of different characteristics of each wine in our cellar. But many of them will measure related properties and so will be redundant. If so, we should be able to summarize each wine with fewer characteristics! This is what PCA does.</p>
<p><strong>Grandmother: This is interesting! So this PCA thing checks what characteristics are redundant and discards them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> Excellent question, granny! No, PCA is not selecting some characteristics and discarding the others. Instead, it constructs some <em>new</em> characteristics that turn out to summarize our list of wines well. Of course, these new characteristics are constructed using the old ones; for example, a new characteristic might be computed as wine age minus wine acidity level or some other combination (we call them <em>linear combinations</em>).</p>
<p>In fact, PCA finds the best possible characteristics, the ones that summarize the list of wines as well as only possible (among all conceivable linear combinations). This is why it is so useful.</p>
<p><strong>Mother: Hmmm, this certainly sounds good, but I am not sure I understand. What do you actually mean when you say that these new PCA characteristics &quot;summarize&quot; the list of wines?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> I guess I can give two different answers to this question. The first answer is that you are looking for some wine properties (characteristics) that strongly differ across wines. Indeed, imagine that you come up with a property that is the same for most of the wines - like the stillness of wine after being poured. This would not be very useful, would it? Wines are very different, but your new property makes them all look the same! This would certainly be a bad summary. Instead, PCA looks for properties that show as much variation across wines as possible.</p>
<p>The second answer is that you look for the properties that would allow you to predict, or &quot;reconstruct&quot;, the original wine characteristics. Again, imagine that you come up with a property that has no relation to the original characteristics - like the shape of a wine bottle; if you use only this new property, there is no way you could reconstruct the original ones! This, again, would be a bad summary. So PCA looks for properties that allow reconstructing the original characteristics as well as possible.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it turns out that these two aims are equivalent and so PCA can kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p><strong>Spouse: But darling, these two &quot;goals&quot; of PCA sound so different! Why would they be equivalent?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> Hmmm. Perhaps I should make a little drawing <em>(takes a napkin and starts scribbling)</em>. Let us pick two wine characteristics, perhaps wine darkness and alcohol content -- I don't know if they are correlated, but let's imagine that they are. Here is what a scatter plot of different wines could look like:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jPw90.png"" alt=""PCA exemplary data"" /></p>
<p>Each dot in this &quot;wine cloud&quot; shows one particular wine. You see that the two properties (<span class=""math-container"">$x$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$y$</span> on this figure) are correlated. A new property can be constructed by drawing a line through the centre of this wine cloud and projecting all points onto this line. This new property will be given by a linear combination <span class=""math-container"">$w_1 x + w_2 y$</span>, where each line corresponds to some particular values of <span class=""math-container"">$w_1$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$w_2$</span>.</p>
<p>Now, look here very carefully -- here is what these projections look like for different lines (red dots are projections of the blue dots):</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q7HIP.gif"" alt=""PCA animation: variance and reconstruction error"" /></p>
<p>As I said before, PCA will find the &quot;best&quot; line according to two different criteria of what is the &quot;best&quot;. First, the variation of values along this line should be maximal. Pay attention to how the &quot;spread&quot; (we call it &quot;variance&quot;) of the red dots changes while the line rotates; can you see when it reaches maximum? Second, if we reconstruct the original two characteristics (position of a blue dot) from the new one (position of a red dot), the reconstruction error will be given by the length of the connecting red line. Observe how the length of these red lines changes while the line rotates; can you see when the total length reaches minimum?</p>
<p>If you stare at this animation for some time, you will notice that &quot;the maximum variance&quot; and &quot;the minimum error&quot; are reached at the same time, namely when the line points to the magenta ticks I marked on both sides of the wine cloud. This line corresponds to the new wine property that will be constructed by PCA.</p>
<p>By the way, PCA stands for &quot;principal component analysis&quot;, and this new property is called &quot;first principal component&quot;. And instead of saying &quot;property&quot; or &quot;characteristic&quot;, we usually say &quot;feature&quot; or &quot;variable&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Daughter: Very nice, papa! I think I can see why the two goals yield the same result: it is essentially because of the Pythagoras theorem, isn't it? Anyway, I heard that PCA is somehow related to eigenvectors and eigenvalues; where are they in this picture?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> Brilliant observation. Mathematically, the spread of the red dots is measured as the average squared distance from the centre of the wine cloud to each red dot; as you know, it is called the <em>variance</em>. On the other hand, the total reconstruction error is measured as the average squared length of the corresponding red lines. But as the angle between red lines and the black line is always <span class=""math-container"">$90^\circ$</span>, the sum of these two quantities is equal to the average squared distance between the centre of the wine cloud and each blue dot; this is precisely Pythagoras theorem. Of course, this average distance does not depend on the orientation of the black line, so the higher the variance, the lower the error (because their sum is constant). This hand-wavy argument can be made precise (<a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/136072/28666"">see here</a>).</p>
<p>By the way, you can imagine that the black line is a solid rod, and each red line is a spring. The energy of the spring is proportional to its squared length (this is known in physics as Hooke's law), so the rod will orient itself such as to minimize the sum of these squared distances. I made a simulation of what it will look like in the presence of some viscous friction:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lNHqt.gif"" alt=""PCA animation: pendulum"" /></p>
<p>Regarding eigenvectors and eigenvalues. You know what a <em>covariance matrix</em> is; in my example it is a <span class=""math-container"">$2\times 2$</span> matrix that is given by <span class=""math-container"">$$\begin{pmatrix}1.07 &amp;0.63\\0.63 &amp; 0.64\end{pmatrix}.$$</span> What this means is that the variance of the <span class=""math-container"">$x$</span> variable is <span class=""math-container"">$1.07$</span>, the variance of the <span class=""math-container"">$y$</span> variable is <span class=""math-container"">$0.64$</span>, and the covariance between them is <span class=""math-container"">$0.63$</span>. As it is a square symmetric matrix, it can be diagonalized by choosing a new orthogonal coordinate system, given by its eigenvectors (incidentally, this is called <em>spectral theorem</em>); corresponding eigenvalues will then be located on the diagonal. In this new coordinate system, the covariance matrix is diagonal and looks like that: <span class=""math-container"">$$\begin{pmatrix}1.52 &amp;0\\0 &amp; 0.19\end{pmatrix},$$</span> meaning that the correlation between points is now zero. It becomes clear that the variance of any projection will be given by a weighted average of the eigenvalues (I am only sketching the intuition here). Consequently, the maximum possible variance (<span class=""math-container"">$1.52$</span>) will be achieved if we simply take the projection on the first coordinate axis. It follows that the direction of the first principal component is given by the first eigenvector of the covariance matrix. (<a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/217995"">More details here.</a>)</p>
<p>You can see this on the rotating figure as well: there is a gray line there orthogonal to the black one; together, they form a rotating coordinate frame. Try to notice when the blue dots become uncorrelated in this rotating frame. The answer, again, is that it happens precisely when the black line points at the magenta ticks. Now I can tell you how I found them (the magenta ticks): they mark the direction of the first eigenvector of the covariance matrix, which in this case is equal to <span class=""math-container"">$(0.81, 0.58)$</span>.</p>

115327,15723.0,2,,40030.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>Stratification seeks to ensure that each fold is representative of all strata of the data. Generally this is done in a supervised way for classification and aims to ensure each class is (approximately) equally represented across each test fold (which are of course combined in a complementary way to form training folds).</p>
<p>The intuition behind this relates to the bias of most classification algorithms. They tend to weight each instance equally which means overrepresented classes get too much weight (e.g. optimizing F-measure, Accuracy or a complementary form of error).  Stratification is not so important for an algorithm that weights each class equally (e.g. optimizing Kappa, Informedness or ROC AUC) or according to a cost matrix (e.g. that is giving a value to each class correctly weighted and/or a cost to each way of misclassifying). See, e.g.
D. M. W. Powers (2014), What the F-measure doesn't measure: Features, Flaws, Fallacies and Fixes. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.06410"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.06410</a></p>
<p>One specific issue that is important across even unbiased or balanced algorithms, is that they tend not to be able to learn or test a class that isn't represented at all in a fold, and furthermore even the case where only one of a class is represented in a fold doesn't allow generalization to performed resp. evaluated. However even this consideration isn't universal and for example doesn't apply so much to one-class learning, which tries to determine what is normal for an individual class, and effectively identifies outliers as being a different class, given that cross-validation is about determining statistics not generating a specific classifier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, supervised stratification compromises the technical purity of the evaluation as the labels of the test data shouldn't affect training, but in stratification are used in the selection of the training instances. Unsupervised stratification is also possible based on spreading similar data around looking only at the attributes of the data, not the true class. See, e.g.
<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/S0004-3702(99)00094-6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0004-3702(99)00094-6</a>

Unsupervised stratification of cross-validation for accuracy estimation.</p>
<p>Stratification can also be applied to regression rather than classification, in which case like the unsupervised stratification, similarity rather than identity is used, but the supervised version uses the known true function value.</p>
<p>Further complications are rare classes and multilabel classification, where classifications are being done on multiple (independent) dimensions.  Here tuples of the true labels across all dimensions can be treated as classes for the purpose of cross-validation. However, not all combinations necessarily occur, and some combinations may be rare. Rare classes and rare combinations are a problem in that a class/combination that occurs at least once but less than K times (in K-CV) cannot be represented in all test folds. In such cases, one could instead consider a form of stratified boostrapping (sampling with replacement to generate a full size training fold with repetitions expected and 36.8% expected unselected for testing, with one instance of each class selected initially without replacement for the test fold).</p>
<p>Another approach to multilabel stratification is to try to stratify or bootstrap each class dimension separately without seeking to ensure representative selection of combinations. With L labels and N instances and Kkl instances of class k for label l, we can randomly choose (without replacement) from the corresponding set of labeled instances Dkl approximately N/LKkl instances. This does not ensure optimal balance but rather seeks balance heuristically. This can be improved by barring selection of labels at or over quota unless there is no choice (as some combinations do not occur or are rare).  Problems tend to mean either that there is too little data or that the dimensions are not independent.</p>

Most of the current notation comes from conventions that were established by the biometric statisticians in the late 19th and early 20th century (most of it was done by Pearson and Fisher and their associates).  A useful list of early uses of notation is maintained by the economist John Aldrich <a href=""http://jeff560.tripod.com/stat.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, and a historical account of the English biometric school is published in <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/1403877"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aldrich (2003)</a>.  (If you have further enquiries about this topic, <a href=""http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/aldrich.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aldrich</a> is probably the world's foremost living expert in the history of notation in statistics.)</p>

<p>Aside from this explicit work, there are a lot of books that give introductions to the field, and these are careful to define notation consistent with common conventions, defining notation as they go.  There are many well-known conventions in this field that run consistently through the literature, and statisticians are well-acquainted with these through practice, even without having read the recommendations of these researchers.</p>

<p><strong>Ambiguity of the distribution-centric notation:</strong> The use of the ""distribution-centric"" notation is a standard convention that is used throughout statistical literature.  However, one interesting thing to point out about this notation is that there is a bit of wiggle-room as to what it actually means.  The standard convention is to read the object on the right-hand-side of these statements as some kind of description of a probability measure (e.g, a distribution function, density function, etc.) and then read the $\sim$ relation with meaning ""...has distribution..."" or ""...has probability measure..."", etc.  Under this interpretation the relation compares two distinct sets of things; the object on the left-hand-side is a random variable and the object on the right-hand-side is a description of a probability measure.</p>

<p>However, it is also equally valid to interpret the right-hand-side as a reference to a random variable (as opposed to a distribution) and read the $\sim$ relation as meaning ""...has the same distribution as..."".  Under this interpretation the relation is an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation"" rel=""noreferrer"">equivalence relation</a> comparing random variables; the objects on the left- and right--hand-sides are both random variables and the relation is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.</p>

<p>This gives two possible (and equally valid) interpretations of a statement like:</p>

<p>$$X \sim \text{N}(\mu, \sigma^2).$$</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Distributional interpretation:</strong> ""$X$ has probability distribution $\text{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$"".  This interpretation takes the latter object to be some description of a normal probability measure (e.g., its density function, distribution function, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Random variable interpretation:</strong> ""$X$ has the same probability distribution as $\text{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$"".  This interpretation takes the latter object to be a normal random variable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each interpretation has advantages and disadvantages.  The advantage of the random-variable interpretation is that it uses the standard symbol $\sim$ to refer to an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation"" rel=""noreferrer"">equivalence relation</a>, but its disadvantage is that it requires reference to random variables with similar notation to their distribution functions.  The advantage of the distributional interpretation is that it uses similar notation for the distributions as a whole, and their functional forms with a given argument value; the disadvantage is that it uses the $\sim$ symbol in a way that is not an equivalence relation.</p>

236322,116224.0,2,,58305.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>Differential entropy should be considered as a measure of <em>relative</em> (privation of) information - not absolute. In particular, note that the differential entropy responds to a change in scale (i.e. you have a logarithm of a unitful quantity, which means that it will depend on the units you measure the axis <span class=""math-container"">$x$</span> in), which is not a concept that makes sense for a discrete information source. The inability to specify an absolute information in this context should be taken as based on the intuitive idea that the amount of information required to specify a specific value in an infinite continuum is itself infinite as you must distinguish one from amongst an infinitude of possibilities to achieve such a specification.</p>
<p>To understand it more precisely, consider a uniform distribution where the differential entropy is zero. A simple example is precisely that which is one unit wide:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$P(x) = \begin{cases}1,\ \mbox{if $x \in [0, 1]$}  \\ 0,\ \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>If you compute the differential entropy, <span class=""math-container"">$h$</span>, of the above distribution, you will find it is zero since <span class=""math-container"">$\ln(1) = 0$</span> and moreover in the appropriate limit <span class=""math-container"">$0 \ln(0)$</span> &quot;equals&quot; 0. This corresponds to the fact you (or the agent to which the Bayesian probability <span class=""math-container"">$P(x)$</span> is specified relative to) know the position (or whatever) of the object to within exactly one unit. If you make the distribution wider, say two units, so you have even less information, then the differential entropy will be <span class=""math-container"">$\ln(2)$</span> or about 0.693. This is the same as the discrete entropy for an infinite discrete set of bins, each standing in for &quot;a unit&quot;, or if you like, the bins between marks on a ruler and where you only report the measurement made with the ruler as a whole number of its finest ticks, now distributed uniformly among two such bins, and means we have 0.697 nats <em>less</em> information now about the position of the particle up to a resolution of one unit.</p>
<p>Negative differential entropy then just means we go the other way - since we <em>aren't</em> working with <em>discrete</em> bins, we can know it &quot;more precisely&quot; than one bin, i.e. to an accuracy less than one unit, and thus the entropy (<em>privation</em> of information) will have to be <em>less</em> now as we are more informed, thus now <em>less than zero</em>. But if I switch to a finer scale, i.e. a smaller unit, then the entropy will once again exceed zero, as now we don't have enough to know it down to that fine scale.</p>
<p>You cannot have an absolute measure because on a continuum, effectively you have an uncountable infinity of &quot;bins&quot; within any arbitrarily small interval, thus even a tiny interval of uncertainty is still effectively infinite information. Thus we have to get up &quot;high into infinity&quot; to measure the differences in entropy in realistic distributions and that is why the &quot;bottom&quot; of differential entropy is at <span class=""math-container"">$-\infty$</span>, which is like a probability zero in a continuous probability measure, and how that such does not necessarily represent impossibility, but rather negligibility with regard to the infinitude of the sets we are considering.</p>
<p>Or to go the other way intuitively, suppose you were treating the continuum as a set of bins - one for each point - like how you do an ordinary discrete random variable. Then with a probability distribution of <span class=""math-container"">$P(x) = \delta(x - a)$</span>, i.e. a delta function at some central real number <span class=""math-container"">$a$</span>, that is one bin occupied, so entropy 0, but if you now have 2 bins with probability 1/2, i.e. <span class=""math-container"">$P(x) = \frac{1}{2} \delta(x - a_1) + \frac{1}{2} \delta(x - a_2)$</span> meaning &quot;we know the particle is at either <span class=""math-container"">$a_1$</span> exactly or <span class=""math-container"">$a_2$</span> exactly but not which&quot;, then by the usual <em>discrete</em> entropy formula you have entropy <span class=""math-container"">$0.693$</span> nat (or <span class=""math-container"">$1$</span> shannon using <span class=""math-container"">$\lg$</span> instead of <span class=""math-container"">$\ln$</span>). But if you continue in this way, long before you reach a truly continuous distribution you will soon &quot;top out&quot; (after a countably infinite number of bins have been summed) using discrete entropy, saturating at positive infinity. And that is what I mean by saying that to then go up into continuous distributions, you then have to &quot;soar up high&quot; - effectively the integral jams in an uncountable infinity and rises your reference point far above the true baseline so you can distinguish the different infinite amounts that are &quot;above the infinite boundary of the discrete entropy&quot;. That rise then, by symmetry, puts the baseline infinitely far below you, or at <span class=""math-container"">$-\infty$</span>, and moreover due to the Archimedean nature of the real numbers, prevents you from distinguishing these finite-bin cases any more (all of them, if you check for yourself, have differential entropy <span class=""math-container"">$-\infty$</span>).</p>

331473,9081.0,2,,58679.0,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p><strong>What is the difference between segmenting and clustering</strong>?</p>
<p>First, let us define the two terms:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Segmentation</strong> partitioning of some whole, some object, into parts vased on similarity and contiguity. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> which gives as an example <em>Segmentation (biology), the division of body plans into a series of repetitive segments</em> and also <a href=""https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/segmentation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oxford</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Clustering</strong> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> says <em>the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters)</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is, in some sense, closely associated. If we consider some whole ABC as consisting of many <em>atoms</em>, like a market consisting of customers, or a body consisting of body parts, we can say that we <em>segment</em>  ABC but <em>cluster</em> the atoms.   But it seems that <em>segmentation</em> is more used when there is some concept of (spatial) contiguity of the atoms within the whole.</p>
<p>There seems to be confusion of this usage. On this site <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?q=custome*+segmenta*"">customer segmentation</a> is often used, it should be <em>market segmentation</em>. The customers are not segmented (hopefully!), they are clustered. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia got it right</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Use in connection with time series</strong>  With multiple (parallel) time series, we can <em>cluster</em> the series into groups of similar series, while <em>segmentation</em> typically refers to partitioning a single series in similar, contiguous, parts. See the tag <a href=""/questions/tagged/timeseries-segmentation"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;timeseries-segmentation&#39;"" rel=""tag"">timeseries-segmentation</a> and <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?q=time-series+cluster*+answers%3A1"">this list of posts about time series clustering</a>.
