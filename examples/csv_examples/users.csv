5237,1028075,gung - Reinstate Monica,Kingdom of Zhao,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongsun_Long,"<p>Stack Exchange's actions have been reprehensible.  Monica Cellio, a popular and well-respected volunteer network moderator, <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193"">was terminated without warning</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334133/187282"">portrayed to the press as misgendering trans people</a> by Stack Overflow, Inc. All signs suggest this was an erroneous, if not malicious, decision not founded on fact, for which the company is completely failing to take any responsibility. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965/187282"">This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in the community.</a></p>

<p>Monica and the community quite literally <strong>begged</strong> for <em>some</em> kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement, or justifying their decision to terminate her, for more than a month now. She made many good-faith offers to talk, and others offered to mediate (and made <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica"">dozens of constructive suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Members of the Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/333992/187282"">1</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731/187282"">2</a>).</p>

<p>Stack Overflow, Inc. met all of this with thunderous silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good faith, I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate callousness of this behavior which we have to assume now is the new normal.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526/187282"">Having exhausted all other means of communication</a>, Monica began raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name.  This process ended with some form of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/340906/187282"">legal agreement</a> that entailed a non-disclosure agreement.  The NDA means that nothing else about the agreement is known.  What can be seen from the outside is that SE offered another lawyer-written non-apology, and issued a statement out of both sides of its mouth to <em>The Register</em> reiterating, falsely, that she did something wrong, but that she isn't really a bad person. We can also see that she was not reinstated.  This episode in the drama is over.  I trust the funds left over will go donated to <a href=""https://www.thetrevorproject.org/about/programs-services/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Trevor Project</a>, an organization that provides crisis-intervention services to LGBTQ+ youth. </p>

<p>Monica is an exemplar of the community, it's incredible how she's managed to keep a level head during this time when emotions have been very high.  She should be <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/336526/187282"">reinstated now</a>.</p>

<p>It is largely because of lack of knowledge of what statistics is that the person untrained in it trusts himself with a tool quite as dangerous as any he may pick out from the whole armamentarium of scientific methodology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Concerning scientific knowledge]  Admission to its sanctuary, and to the privileges and feelings of a votary, is only to be gained by one means—<em>sound and sufficient knowledge of mathematics, the great instrument of all exact inquiry, without which no man can ever make such advances in this or any other of the higher departments of science as can entitle him to form an independent opinion on any subject of discussion within their range.</em></p>

I'm director at QQ Trends, a company that solves difficult data and software challenges for our clients. Lots of machine learning, especially NLP-related, recently. (We sometimes have freelance projects, so get in touch if interested.)
(Contact me at dc at qqtrend dot com: please mention you are coming from StackOverflow, so I know it is not spam.)</p>

<p>My first book was ""Data Push Apps with HTML5 SSE"", with O'Reilly, 2014 (ISBN: 978-1449371937). Old by computer standards, but the standard has been stable, so surprisingly still useful. My second book, at the end of 2016, also with O'Reilly, was Practical Machine Learning with H2O (ISBN: 978-1491964606).</p>

<p>I'm British, speak English and Japanese (fairly fluent, 1 kyu), with a bit of German, Chinese and Arabic. As for computer languages, I've done commercial work in most of them; but it has been mostly JavaScript, R, Python, C++ the past five years.</p>

<p>All my Stack Overflow and all my Stack Exchange contributions (across all sites) are dedicated to the public domain or available under the CC0 license at your choice. I don't like viral licenses.</p>

<p>Easy ways to irritate me on StackExchange sites (whether my own question or someone else's): 1. Downvote without a comment (N/A if someone already left a comment and you just agree with it, of course); 2. Answers in comments. Other than that I'm an easy-going and pragmatic guy :-)</p>

<p>I am a currently retired biostatistician and last worked at the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research where I worked on lab experiments, clinical trials and other medical research.  I have a PhD in Statistics from Stanford University.  I have published books on bootstrap and biostatistics and have written or coauthored many articles in statistics, mathematics and medical journals.  I am an ASA Fellow and have also been a member of ENAR, the IMS, the Bernoulli Society and the Royal Statistical Society. I like teaching and mentoring and doing puzzles (crossword, cryptograms and Sudoku) I used to play chess with my son Daniel but I am getting rusty at it as I age and he started beating me too often. I have been retired since 2012.  I was very active at CrossValidated in 2011, but have not contributed from 2012-2016. I resumed activity in November 2016 and am hoping to finish a few books I had abandoned and I hope to get back to doing some part time consulting at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Hobby: I like to fly in private aircraft (passenger or supernumerary crew) and I do it several times a year sometimes by arrangement and sometimes by ""hitchhiking"" at private fields. By arrangement I do stuff like baby sitting, pet delivery, chaperoning, translating, mock landing interviews, and gift delivery. The furthest east I have been is London -> Samarkand (single engine Cherokee). The furthest west I have been is London -> Los Angeles (many different aircraft, including a G650). The most stressful are the landings at Nuuk to refuel.  The easiest airport to ""hitch"" a ride is in Texas USA.</p>

5671,1058083,Has QUIT--Anony-Mousse,disappeared into oblivion,,https://stats.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5783/reinstate-monica,"<p>I have decided to finally <strong>QUIT StackOverflow</strong> at the end of 2019.</p>

<ol>
<li>Key issues such as <strong>duplicates are still not resolved</strong>. Measures like <em>not allowing</em> to post duplicates are not implemented; nor a recommender that helps users choose the most appropriate site, or ask better questions. This puts the burden on the frequent users and moderators to keep the site useful. At the same time, duplicates and low-quality questions do cause rude comments and answers in the first place. Solving this properly <em>would</em> likely make the tone much nicer.</li>
<li>Migration of questions is a complicated procedure, rather than simply making the different sites ""views"" on the same underlying data. There is a random set of migrations that can be proposed (such as SO to stats.SE), but no way to propose others (e.g., to DS.SE) They are making our lives harder than necessary.</li>
<li>We can't flag duplicates of questions on other SE sites, even if there is a perfect duplicate.</li>
<li>The company wastes tons of money on stupid things such as WinterBash, and on projects doomed to fail such as ""SO Documentation"" and ""SO for Teams"". I understand that you need to generate more revenue, but you should listen to your users (in particular to avoid <em>costly</em> failures such as documentation).</li>
<li><strong>The company does not listen to their users.</strong> A recent example is the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/340906/update-an-agreement-with-monica-cellio"">Monica incident</a>. This lawyeresque statement shows what is wrong: they fight their best users. But there are many more examples. ""User surveys"" that sound like they come from the sales department, not from user support; that avoid any of the big issues such as duplicates, low quality questions, and the resulting sometimes rude handling of such questions; and many more.</li>
<li>I do want to emphasize that I am in general <strong>in favor of a ""code of conduct""</strong>, and I do strongly believe we need to fight for diversity. I am all in favor of using stated pronouns, but I know that I would get them wrong often. I have not seen any of the transcripts, so I have no idea what Monica did, but we also all have heard of false accusations, mistakes, and so on. I do not think the situation was handled well by SO staff, and it only got worse and worse. A code of conduct that are community standards should actually come from the community, and be handled by the community, not by some higher entity like the company.</li>

That is I am particularly interested in building computationally and cognitively plausible models of how we learn and communicate about the world, and how to get computers/robots to learn and communicate about the world in a similar way, as well as how better to teach people languages and about language. </p>

<p>From the perspective of learning, my focus is on unsupervised learning - children learn to speak without a teacher, without being taught what nouns and verbs are.  From the perspective of language, I like Tagmemics and Cognitive Linguistics - consistent with my focus on unsupervised learning, language and learning boil down to what we think is similar.  </p>

<p>Formally this gives rise to similarity or distance measures used in learning, and we also need to account chance levels or prevalences.  It also gives rise to metaphor, metonymy, grammar and related linguistic constructs, which define Cognitive Linguistics, as well as the basic ideas of Phonemic and Tagmemic analysis, Contrast in Analogous Environments and Complementary Distribution.  It similarly explains the richness of polysemy and why there is really no such thing as synonymy, as when anything is different we look for other things to be different to learn from, using the part that is similar as context or paradigm, a substrate for the learning.  We are continuously developing and modifying the range of meaning of language with our personal, social and cultural development, as we press old words or morphemes into new roles.</p>
