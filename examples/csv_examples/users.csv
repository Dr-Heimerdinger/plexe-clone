<hr />
<p>I like to answer questions on stats.stackexchange.com, which doesn't directly seem to be my main field, but the applied mathematics is very general.</p>
<p>In addition, I have learned a lot from spending time on the website, and (to be honest) a lot of my answers depend mostly on research skills.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why do I use the nickname &quot;Sextus Empiricus&quot;?</p>
<p>I originally used my own name, but I changed it into a nickname because of dissatisfaction, with StackExchange management during 2020.</p>
<p>I chose the name SE because his works are like my bible (my other favorite philosophical writings are from Descartes and Wittgenstein), and because the initials resemble a particular website.</p>
<p>Currently I slightly regret carrying such a big name as a nickname, but I also see it as fun and try to remain close to his philosophy. I can also be happy that I didn't change my nickname into Ronald Fisher.</p>
