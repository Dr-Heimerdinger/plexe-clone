I am working with the data is loaded into the `f1` database (connection string: `postgresql+psycopg2://mlflow:mlflow@postgres:5432/f1`).
I want to define a predictive task on this relational database.
- Task definition: For each driver predict the if they will DNF (did not finish) a race in the next 15 days.
- Evaluation metric: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC).
I don't have any requirements, if you need them you can set by default automatically.
