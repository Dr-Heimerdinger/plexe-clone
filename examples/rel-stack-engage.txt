I am working with the data is loaded into the `stack-2000` database (connection string: `postgresql+psycopg2://mlflow:mlflow@postgres:5432/stack-2000`).
I want to define a predictive task on this relational database.
Task definition: Predict if the user will make any contribution, defined as a vote, comment, or post, to the site in the next 2 days.
Entity filtering: We filter on active users defined as users that have made at least one comment/post/vote before the timestamp.
Machine learning task: Binary classification. The label is 1 when a user contributes to the site and 0 otherwise.
Evaluation metric: Average Precision (AP).
I don't have any requirements, if you need them you can set by default automatically.
