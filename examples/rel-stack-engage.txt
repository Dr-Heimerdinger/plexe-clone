I am working with the data is loaded into the `stack_200` database (connection string: `postgresql+psycopg2://mlflow:mlflow@postgres:5432/stack_200`).
I want to define a predictive task on this relational database.
Task definition: Predict if the user will make any contribution, defined as a vote, comment, or post, to the site in the next 2 days.
Entity filtering: We filter on active users defined as users that have made at least one comment/post/vote before the timestamp.
Task significance: By accurately forecasting the levels of user contribution, website administrators can effectively gauge
and oversee user activity. This insight allows for well-informed choices across various business aspects. For instance,
it aids in preempting and mitigating user attrition, as well as in enhancing strategies to foster increased user interaction
and involvement. This predictive task serves as a crucial tool in optimizing user experience and sustaining a dynamic and
engaged user base.
Machine learning task: Binary classification. The label is 1 when a user contributes to the site and 0 otherwise.
Evaluation metric: Average Precision (AP).
---------------------------------------------------------
For the input schema:

Represent each table as nodes in a heterogeneous graph
Use primary-foreign key relationships to define edges between entities
Apply temporal constraints where only entities with timestamps less or equal prediction time can influence the model
For the users table, filter to 'active users' (those who made at least one contribution in the past 10 days before each timestamp)

For the training table generation:

Create timestamps by moving backwards from the validation cutoff in 2-day intervals
For each timestamp t, label users as 1 if they made any contribution (vote or comment or post) between t and t+2 days, 0 otherwise, and a suitable (set of) foreign keys  indicating the entities the training example is associated to
Ensure temporal consistency: the model should only see data with timestamps less or equal t when predicting for time t
Here are some examples:
timestamp,OwnerUserId,contribution,
2012-01-12,352,1
2010-10-14,7,1

For model solutions to try, I'd recommend 1-3 different approaches:

GNN-based model: Graph Neural Network with heterogeneous temporal message passing
GNN with different architectures: Vary the message passing layers (2-layer, 3-layer, 4-layer)
please proceed.
