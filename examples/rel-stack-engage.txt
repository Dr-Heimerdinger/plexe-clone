I am working with the data is loaded into the `stack_200` database (connection string: `postgresql+psycopg2://mlflow:mlflow@postgres:5432/stack_200`).
I want to define a predictive task on this relational database.
Task definition: Predict if the user will make any contribution, defined as a vote, comment, or post, to the site in the next 2 days.
Entity filtering: We filter on active users defined as users that have made at least one comment/post/vote before the timestamp.
Task significance: By accurately forecasting the levels of user contribution, website administrators can effectively gauge
and oversee user activity. This insight allows for well-informed choices across various business aspects. For instance,
it aids in preempting and mitigating user attrition, as well as in enhancing strategies to foster increased user interaction
and involvement. This predictive task serves as a crucial tool in optimizing user experience and sustaining a dynamic and
engaged user base.
Machine learning task: Binary classification. The label is 1 when a user contributes to the site and 0 otherwise.
Evaluation metric: Average Precision (AP).
Here are some examples for the training table:
timestamp,OwnerUserId,contribution,
2012-01-12,352,1
2010-10-14,7,1
please proceed.
