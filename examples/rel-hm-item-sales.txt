I am working with the data is loaded into the `hm` database (connection string: `postgresql+psycopg2://mlflow:mlflow@postgres:5432/hm`).
I want to define a predictive task on this relational database.
- Database Description: The H&M relational database hosts extensive customer and product data for online shopping experiences across its extensive network of brands and stores. This database includes detailed customer purchase histories and a rich set of metadata, encompassing everything from basic demographic information to extensive details about each product available.
- Task definition:Predict the total sales for an article (the sum of prices of the associated transactions) in the next week.
- Evaluation metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
I don't have any requirements, if you need them you can set by default automatically.
